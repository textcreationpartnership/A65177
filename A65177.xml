            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He purpoſes and counſells of Gods mind are firſt taken within himſelf, before they are or can be knowne to any other. They are therefore called the deepe and hidden things of God. For God is his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour. There is none that can inſtruct him. His mind is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all that can be knowne and conſulted upon, but hath thoſe eternall ſprings of light and power, by which he is the ſupreame cauſe and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of all things. And theſe, as to their manner and kind of operation, are three. Theſe firſt and great powers are they, who in their name and manifeſtation are the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, by whom the ſame God doth forme and take all his counſells within himſelf, and put them in execution according to the purpoſe of his owne mind. Theſe are the ſeverall diſtinct powers of diſcerning and will in the ſame divine eſſence. With the firſt of them, God minds things after his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibile manner of being, knowing and willing them, as God. Of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern there is no imitation. I am, ſays God, and there is none beſides me. With the ſecond, God minds things on earth or in the world, condeſcending to proportion himſelf in his knowledg and will to the creature, in order to be found in the likenes and fashion of created nature, and ſo to act over the law firſt in himſelf, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be capable to imitate and fulfill it after him. With the third he does ſo admirably joyne and put both theſe minds into one, and fix them in ſuch moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony and love, that they are not to be divided; yet keeps and upholds in each, their proper and diſtinct operations.</p>
            <p>By this threefold operation, God ſets up the eternall law, and cauſes the manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that which is the very wiſedome and reaſon of God himſelf, the head of Chriſt, the perſon of the bleſſed mediatour. For he who thus is three in counſell, (wherein he decrees and orders all things, giving the law in one and the ſame eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mind) does not execute by himſelfe immediatly, but by the Mediatour, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative or image, the Angel of his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in whom his name or likenes is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in order to beare it and bring it forth into the ſight and participation of others. By the immediate operation of the Trinity he is made and conſtituted the Lords Chriſt and true Meſſiah, the ſecondary and executing power, ordeined by God, as the breath and voyce of his mouth, to fulfill all his wills and all the counſells of his heart. This is he who was from the beginning, the breath of God, the inſpiration of the Almighty, the face and image of the inviſible God,</p>
            <p>Firſt by eternall generation within the mind of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By everlaſting emanation, as the outſhining light and expreſs character of he divine eſſence.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93838:3"/>3. By temporall incarnation and inſeparable perſonal union whith the ſeed of David.</p>
            <p>According to his eternal generation, he is without Father, without Mother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcent, coeternally and coeſſentially God with the Father, or firſt cauſe of all; no leſſe truly and properly God, then God himſelfe. But that which he is by ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting emanation, is the firſt born of every creature, he that was before all things, and by whom all things conſiſt. And according to his temporall incarnation, he was made man, like unto us in all things, ſin only excepted.</p>
            <p>He is the inward writing of the eternal law, that is written and lies within the boſome of the father. None can read or unlooſe the ſeales on the backſide of this writing, but the lion of the tribe of Judah, he that from eternity hath knowne Gods mind and bin his counſellour, as the almighty breath of his month, inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and giving life and being to all things, which when put forth, doth execute moſt exactly all that the dictates of Gods mind require to be done. Without him is not any thing made that is made; Nay, admit the creature could receave being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him (which it cannot) yet the eternal law and will of God could never be knowne to angels or men, unleſſe revealed to them by this lively oracle and voyce of his month. For all things are delivered to him of the father, and none knows who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveale him. No man hath ſeen God at any time. The only begotten Son which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him; even he that was in the beginning, was found in the forme of God and thought it not robbery to be equall with God; the WORD in whom is life, and that life the light of men. By him comes all hearing, underſtanding and obedience to be wrought in the creature. The firſt creature in which it is wrought, is the building not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, made part of himſelf, who as Mediatour is a mixed ſeed of both natures in one perſon and Spirit. In this Spirit he comes in the diſpenſation of the fulnes of time, to be made flesh, and ſo hath in him the voice of God, the voice of the head and cheif of angels, and of the head and cheife of men, by meanes whereof he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and converſes with all created underſtandings, in their owne likenes and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Thus comes he to be that ſpirituall ladder and way of graduall entercourſe, by means whereof, the angels that are aſcending and deſcending upon him, doe keepe the doore open betweene heaven and earth, and he fils al things.</p>
            <p>This is Gods firſt, beſt and moſt perfect worke, finished from the beginning, the works that are ſo much the object of Gods knowledg and delight, that he therein reſts, ſubjecting them no more to change. This is the building not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, the inviſible and exemplary paterne unto both creations; the rock, whence they flow, Deut. 32.4. He is the rock, his work is perfect, or he is the rock that is Gods perfect work; the wiſedome which God poſſeſſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his way, (in which he was pleaſed to condeſcend and ſet forward toward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93838:3"/> the creation of the world) Prov, 8. and 9. chapters; which compared with John. 1.1, 2; doe evidently shew him to be the WORD that was by God as one brought up with him, who was with God and was God; Gods love and delight, in whom he was ever rejoycing. He alſo had his love, delight or choice, in conformity to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will and purpoſe of God, among the ſons of men, that he makes the habitable part of his earth, of whom David was the type and figure, Pſal. 89. where God ſays (v. 20. &amp;c.) I have found David my Servant, with my holy oyle have Ianointed him. With him shall my hand be eſtablished: mine arme alſo ſhall ſtrengthen him. I will beat down his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him. I will ſet his hand alſo in the ſea: his right hand in the rivers. He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my ſalvation. Alſo I will make him my firſt borne: higher then the kings of the earth. I have ſworn by my holines, that I will not lie unto him. His ſeed ſhall endure for ever: his throne as the ſun before me. Againe, Pſal. 78; 70, &amp;c. He choſe David alſo his Servant, and took him from the sheepfolds, from following the ews great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Iſrael his inheritance. So he fed them according to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his heart: and guided them by the ſkilfulnes of his hands. Moſt of this is accomplished in Chriſt, the antitype and Truth, as he is the Son of Man, of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh, called Gods Servant the BRANCH, and the Lord our righteouſnes, the WORD of life, that is the rock of ages, whence all things are hewen. He is the platform and exemplary patern of both worlds, in idea as wel as execution, which the divine wiſedom contrived and wrought in God, from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, as its great maſterpeice, by which the worlds were made; Heb. 1.2. Eph. 3.9. God made all things by Jeſus Chriſt, whether viſible or inviſible. He was the firſt patern of all his works. Conſequently, according to this firſt and perfect patern was man made, and to it in ſome degree and meaſure reſtored ſince his deformation by the fall. In uprightnes was he made, according to Gods image; God is righteous originally in his owne nature, and both originally and communicatively righteous in Chriſt, who made man upright; Eccl: 7.29.</p>
            <p>The houſe which wiſdom firſt builds for her ſelf with ſeven pillars, is in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, Gods only begotten ſon. For he that built all things is God: and this, as the Son over his owne houſe, a houſe not made with hands: that eternal houſe of the Father, wherein are many manſions. The ſame WISEDOME, after ſhe had built her houſe, killed her killing, ſlew her ſacrifice, (the lamb was ſlaine from the beginning of the world) mingled her wine and alſo furnished her table. All things being thus made ready for her gueſts whom ſhe purpoſed to invite, ſhe ſends forth her ſervants. She crieth upon the higheſt places of the city; who ſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth underſtanding, ſhe ſaith to him, come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mingled. Jt ſhal be to your ſoules as a tree of life, a wel ſpringing up into everlaſting life, in every one of you.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93838:4"/>
            <p>But (as we shal shew more fully afterwards) man in his perfect, innocent ſtate, profeſſing himſelf wiſe (when he should have ſeen himſelf ſimple, or at moſt, wiſe only in part, wanting yet that which should make him fully and immutably ſo) became a fool. And becauſe when he knew God, he glorified him not as God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was thankful, he became vain in his imagination, changing the glory or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the incorruptible God manifeſted in Chriſt, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, four-footed beaſts and creeping things, to the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his foolish heart, that changed the TRUTH of God into a lie (the original and firſt ſin) worshipping and ſerving the creature more then the Creatour, God, bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Conformity to Chriſt, the firſt and moſt perfect patern and Rule of all obedience unto Gods word and declared will, is the TRUTH of God, which the firſt Adam changed into a lie, endeavouring (as much as in him lay) to make it void, and ſet up ſome other thing, even himſelf in the place thereof, (as the law and Rule of his action) which he was forbidden. In departing from and diſobeying of Chriſt who was the law of Gods mouth from the beginning, the word that was commanded to a thouſand generations, he taſted the bitter fruit of his own doings, and was enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the work of his owne hands. He was enticed by his owne luſt: ſin conceaved, which being perfected, brought forth death.</p>
            <p>And if it be objected; 'twas impoſſible the firſt Adam should ſin againſt Chriſt, or the TRUTH of God as it is in Jeſus, becauſe where there is no law, there can be no tranſgreſſion; when as yet nothing was declared of Chriſt, there could be no offence againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is eaſy and plain. There was both knowledge and need of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, as well to prevent and keep out ſin from entring into the world, as to expiate and deliver from it by his death, after it was entered, and ſecure againſt its return againe. This the Apoſtle Paul aſſerts with great cleernes in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Romans, shewing that Adam was but the Image and figure of him that was to come, Chriſt, made from the beginning the power of God unto Salvation, and the righteouſnes of God that was to be revealed from faith to faith. This, man at his creation and before his fall could not be ignorant of. For that which might be known of God in Chriſt by the book of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was shewed to him and made manifeſt in him. For the inviſible things of him, (even of Chriſt, who is the inviſible image of God and hidden myſtery ordeined for our glory before the world, and kept ſecret in God) were cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen and to be known by the things that are made, the creatures he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to the making manifeſt his eternal power and Godhead, thereby rendring them without excuſe that would otherwiſe be apt to make the forementioned objection, and on that preſumption thinke themſelvs at liberty to change Gods truth into a lie. But hereby every mouth comes to be ſtopped, and al the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93838:4"/> guilty world are ſubjected to the righteous judgment of God.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, who is the law of Gods mouth, required of man obedience as ſoon as he was created. He called upon him to be a hearer of the will of God, which he was intruſted to reveale, and teach the moſt acceptable manner of performing. This did Chriſt require and teach, as anſwering the end for which man was at all made by him at firſt, or redeemed ſince; even this, that he should not be his owne, or at his owne diſpoſe, but yeild ſubjection to the will of another, ſet over him by God, who was to be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, and to be therfore truſted and beleeved on, as appointed to feed and guide him to life eternall, and who required that he should glorify God in his ſoule and in his body, that were Gods, upon the account of al rights and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thus was Chriſt typified to Adam by the tree of life in the midſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God; as alſo by the living water, that watered the garden of Eden, a river cleer as cryſtall, the ſtreams whereof refresh and make glad the city of God, the Holy place of the tabernacle of the moſt high, Mount Zion that cannot be moved, in the midſt of whom God dwells, as the place of his reſt, promiſing to help them with his morning appearance, or the brightnes and glory of his ſecond comming and fuller communication of himſelf, then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam receaved in his firſt creation, God was willing Adam should know he was a fountain without botom; ſo deep, as not to be drawn dry; and would have him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth wide that he might fill it. He would have him become a veſſel yet more larg, capacious and fit for his uſe, then at firſt he was made. For he gives not his gifts all at once, but by degrees and after a manner moſt ſuitable to his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible fulnes and infinit wiſdom.</p>
            <p>God therefore comes forth in Chriſt as a light and law to mans knowledg and diſcerning, inſtructing him to be the hearer and doer of his will, in and under a threefold law and rule of righteouſnes;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The law of nature, or booke of the creature, viſible and inviſible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The law of the Scriptures or written book of the revealed will of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, written by the living WORD himſelf, in the tables of the heart of the Son of Man, taken into hypoſtatical u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, to be his mouth and ſpokesman, at whoſe hand angels and men are to receave the lively divine oracles of Gods counſel, appointed to be made known unto them.</p>
            <p>This threefold law is, as it were, ſo many tranſcribed duplicates and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of what is to be found in the living eternall WORD of God, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. In conjunction with this, they are lights and good guides. They
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93838:5"/> are as a firſt, ſecond and third ſtream of one and the ſame river of pure and cleer water, that gradually leade into that great Ocean of knowledg, light and love, that is to be found in the original. They are prepared and fitted as the ſutable, adaequate means to be mans guide and Rule, according to his ſtate and meaſure of growth up into his head, in and upon whom he may be borne and made to grow as on his root, that may either receave and retein him in an eternal aboad with him, or elſe leave, reject and finally caſt him off, after proof and triall, as an unprofitable branch, that hath taken Gods name and born his likenes in vain, and that shal therfore not be held guiltles, but firſt or laſt meet with his due reward. This is ſeen and found by the experience of angels and men, from the beginning to this preſent day.</p>
            <p>Of theſe three laws then we shal treate in their order, very breifly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, as to the law of nature or book of the creature, it is no other then the right fashion and make which is given by the creatour to the works of his owne hands, as the creature comes fresh and pure out of the mould into which he caſt it in its firſt creation, bearing his image, ſuperſcription or impreſſion. In a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, he created man in his owne image. Through the power of the enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening breath from the mouth of the Lord, all things live, move and have their being; ſuch a being, and ſuch a manner and meaſure of operation, as God ſees fit for them, and pronounces to be good, though not immutably or perpetually ſo, but ſubject to ſpending, wearing out and waxing old, as alſo to other changes. Theſe are the many things which God creates, which being animated with life from him, doe ſpeak forth the prayſe and excellency of their maker, and are as ſo many kinds of voices and ſounds in the world, none of which are without their ſignification and teaching to thoſe that have eyes to ſe and eares to heare, with skil to ſpel and put together Gods mind out of them, as a law and rule for their inſtruction. The reaſon and diſcerning given to angels and men, does qualify and enable them for this, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſpel out the mind of God, partly by looking forth into the outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible frame of the creation, but more eſpecially by conſulting the light within them, the work or impreſſion of the law in their owne hearts and upon their owne beings, which makes them a law and rule to them ſelves and to one another. For by the tongue of man God ſpeaks to angels in the perſon of Chriſt. By the tongue of angels he ſpeaks in and to men. This is the law that was given to Adam in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the law of the Scriptures or written word of God, it is a ſecond diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, a voice of words, and that by men, the Servants and Prophets of the Lord, who being inſpired with ye breath of Gods living WORD, are taught to think and ſpeak as the Holy Ghoſt moves them or gives them utterance. Under theſe words there is an inward Teſtimony and writing, which is not of private interpretation.</p>
            <p>Theſe words and divine oracles, committed to writing, are kept by the ſpecial influence of Gods providence, and recorded for the ſucceeding ages and poſterity of the Church. Theſe oracles, with the help of the ſame Spirit that indighted them.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93838:5"/> (and alone is able to shew the right meaning and ſound underſtanding of them) are able to make men wiſe unto Salvation, by ſending them to their Saviour, the ſon and living WORD him ſelf, in and with whom alone, they may have life eternal. All that is thus written and recorded is that which is given for this very end by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſnes, that the man of God may be perfect, and perfected unto all good works.</p>
            <p>Under this diſpenſation by a voice of words, the ſeed of faith lies hid. It was not given till four hundred and thirty years after the promiſe and the making known of the law of faith unto Abraham, without and before the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word. And it was not added to make the promiſe void, or as a law that in and by itſelf could give life, eſpecially life immutable, not ſubject againe to wrath and the curſe. But it had its uſe and ſervice in ſubordination and as a Schoolmaſter, pointing to him that was to follow, the ſeed that was to come. It was as the baptiſm of repentance preached by John, which in reſpect of transgreſſions, was to cleanſe and prepare the way of the Lord in the hearts of the Sons of men, dead by nature in treſpaſſes and ſins. The Lord that afterward was to be revealed through faith, would have their ſoules purged and kept as wel fenced as might be in the mean time, againſt all impurity of evill doing, by this law of written words, which was alſo a witnes afterwards of Chriſts birth, death and reſurrection.</p>
            <p>This is a ſecond law that after the fall was given to man as a light or lamp to his feet and lanthorn to his paths: a light, but under a cover, and in a dark place, ſealed and bound up as amongſt Chriſts owne diſciples, who are taught and learned in the wiſdom that is from above. Otherwiſe, as it may be uſed, receaving a ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the wiſdom of the earthly and ſenſual man, or from the ſubtil skill of the Serpent, it does become the fortreſſe and ſtrong hold of ſin, a miniſtry of the letter and of death, a moſt dark and uncertain guide to any that pretend and profeſs them ſelvs to be the followers of it and of the commands in it. For the viſion of all is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as of a book or letter that is ſealed, which when delivered to one that is learned after the manner of men, and not illuminated with the Spirit of TRUTH, ſaying, read this I pray thee, he ſayes (or at leaſt should ſay) I cannot, for it is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and I need one to open it. And when it is delivered to him that is not learned in any kind, he anſwers, (if he deale ingennouſly) I am not learned; I have not that skill which is required for the reading of it, nor can I ſe any more into the true meaning of it, them one that cannot read at all, or tell how to ſpell words and put letters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>The voice and ſound of this law is not of that extent as the firſt, (which is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the tongue and ſpeech of angels, and other peeces of the creation) but is more peculiar to one ſort of men, who formerly were they of the ſeed of Abraham according to the flesh, unto whom God more eſpecially committed theſe his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93838:6"/> expecting anſwerable fruit from all thoſe that having ſinned under this law, were reſerved by God to be judged and at laſt to ſtand or fall by it. The reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind amongſt the gentiles that lived without this law, were not to be judged by it; but by their owne law, the law of nature, unto which they are perpetually ſtill obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. This generation of the fleshly ſeed of Abraham is neither literally nor figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as yet paſſed away. For there are too many that ſince the light of the Goſpel hath sinned forth upon them, doe yet deſire to be under the law, preferring their ſtation and lot in the earthly Jeruſalem, Mount Sinai, that is ſtil in bondage with her children, and chooſe ſo to remaine, rather then to aſcend into the Jeruſalem that is above and is free.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the branches Spoken of, Rom. 11. taken out from among the Gentiles, upon the rejection of Abrahams natural ſeed, who contrary to nature are graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into the good olive tree, ſurrogated and taken by God as a nation or people to himſelf in ſtead of the other, in the ſame relation, under the ſame Covenant and law, being made to partake of the root and fatnes of the ſame olive tree. Theſe are (notwithſtanding all their priviledges in this eſtate) to take heed of boaſting or taking up their reſt under the dominion and in the inward principles of that law which excludes not boaſting. If they doe, they are fairly warned that their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and aboad in and with the root, is not ſo ſure, nor their righteous principles and operations in conformiry to the law, ſo fixed, but that they may fall and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as their predeceſſours the Iews were before them, to wit, all ſuch of them, whoſe ſtanding was but by that Covenant, and not by the law of faith, for want whereof God complains againſt them (Heb. 3.) as children of his wrath and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a perverſe, crooked and froward generation, that alwayes erre in their hearts and have not known his wayes. At laſt, they come to nothing; never enter into Gods reſt, though they thinke themſelves (and in ſome ſort are) a nation that works righteouſnes, in ſtrict obſervance of the letter of all Gods Ordinances and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>This is the ſame law that was by God written in the heart of Adam at the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being renewed and published after the fall, firſt by the miniſtry of angels in the hand of a Mediatour on Mount Sinai; which word, ſpoken by angels, remained ſtedfaſt in its revenging property againſt all that contemned and diſobeyed it. Hence is it ſaid in another place, the law works wrath, and is ſure in inflicting the penalties and curſe threatned. It was committed to writing by Moſes, the Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. Even in the Goſpel the law is fulfilled and made honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. By the doctrine of it, man is taught what he ought to doe and what not to doe. He is bound up to perfect and exact obedience to it, and by reward and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is either encouraged to obedience or reſtrained from diſobedience, being left to his owne diſpoſe and choiſe, as to any thing of prevailing influence which this law diſpenſes. Yet is there that in the doctrin of it, which ſends all under it to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93838:6"/> Chriſt as the only way and means of their ſalvation, shewing who this Chriſt is, and that they muſt beleeve in him or perish in their ſins, and that by beleeving in him they may attein the remiſſion of their ſins, and life eternal.</p>
            <p>This diſtinct knowledg of Chriſt the Redemer, Adam had not, nor properly could have before the fall. Nevertheleſſe, by the things rhat were made, and from the voices and ſignifications of Gods mind miniſtred by the tongue of Angels, (which Adam in Paradiſe was capable of hearing and vnderſtanding) and out of the book of the creature, more eſpecially the tree of life, he was (and might have bin more then he was) inſtructed in the maine point, as to who and what Chriſt was, and how the comming to him and feeding upon him, was the only way and means to make man immutable in righteouſnes, by obtaining an inſeperable union with the cheif good, without ever falling into ſin, yea, as the only ſure means to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the fall.</p>
            <p>In the third and laſt place, there is the law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, the immediate writing and engraving of Gods owne mind, true in it ſelf and true in the receaver of it, the heart of Jeſus the Son of man, the living tables upon which the living WORD by way of ſelf-impreſſion and perſonal union, does ſeale and lay hold on that one ſeed, which is Chriſt, making it the brightnes of his glory, the expreſſe character of his eſſential mind, which is righteouſnes and holines itſelf. This is the WORD that is neer thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayſt doe it; that is to ſay, in the heart and mouth of Chriſt the ſecond Adam, and head of al true beleevers, by him to be poured out as an anointing for the whole ſeed, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thereby the viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mind ſo plain to them, that he that runs may read it.</p>
            <p>The miniſtry of this law is a voice, that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, invites all freely to come to the waters, every one that is a thirſt, and he that hath no mony, to come, buy and eat: yea, to come and buy wine and milk without mony and without price, that they may eat that which is good and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfs in fatnes. This firſt general voice and invitation leaves it to mans choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wil obey and come, or not.</p>
            <p>But this law and miniſtry hath alſo in it a ſecond voice, that carries with it ſuch a prevailing attractive power, ſuch an unreſiſtible conſtraining loue, as will receave or admit no deniall. It does ſo powerfully encline the eare and heart to heare and obey, that by means of this effectual ſaving grace, there is made an everlaſting Covenant between Chriſt and the ſoule, even the ſure mercies of David. Chriſt himſelf in this diſpenſation is given to be a witnes, commander and leader to thoſe that are under it, upon ſuch teams as never to faile, leave or forſake them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt of theſe voices in its miniſtry, is tearmed in Scripture the day of Chriſt, firſt appearance, which hath already riſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and had its kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in word and alſo in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but ſowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in weakenes. It hath shined upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, had its beginning and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and is now drawing very neer to its ending, wherein Chriſt is to be rejected, and that by his owne citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a generation that are inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the earthly Jeruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93838:7"/> vnder the name of Chriſtians, ſucceeding their predeceſſours the jews, (into whoſe room they are ſurrogated) in their froward and bitter principles and Spirit, wherein they pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men.</p>
            <p>This is called the Goſpel of the Kingdom, preached (by means of the outward word, accompanied with the Spirit) to all nations, as a witnes, before the end come; or before that diſpenſation come, that puts an end to it, as perfective of it, reſtoring it out of its dying and declining ſtate, into a brightnes and glory that is everlaſting, as shalbe declared at the riſing of the witneſſes.</p>
            <p>It began with the miniſtry of John Baptiſt, as the voice of him crying in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtreight. It was continued, encreaſed and carried up to its height, even by the perſonal miniſtry of the Son of God manifeſted in flesh, who was born of a virgin, died for our ſins and roſe againe, according to the Scriptures. And by his aſcending up on high, he did lead captivity captive and gave gifts to men, went on in the greatnes of his ſtrengh, conquering to conquer, till the war and oppoſition ſprang up that was raiſed againſt him by the man of ſin, and Son of perdition, for the ſpace of 42 months or 1260 years, to the overſpreading the face of the church with apoſtacy and thick darknes. Herein ſo great a progreſſe hath bin made, that we are brought (as it were) to the shutting in of the evening of this firſt glorious Goſpel day and new Teſtament miniſtry in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and by the written word, to the verifying that Scripture (Luk. 17. which ſayes, The dayes will come when ye shal deſire to ſe one of the dayes of the Son of Man, and ye shall not ſe it, becauſe the light of it muſt withdraw, to give place and make way for the approaching glory of another of the dayes of the Son of Man, even that of his ſecond appearance and Kingdom, at which time he shall shew himſelf the only Potentate over all the earth, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond voice and miniſtry of the Goſpel, above mentioned, performed in and by Chriſts ſecond appearance, is that which (as hath bin ſaid) doth powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encline and prevailingly work upon the hearts of men for the obedience of Gods law, binding up their ſoules in the life that is eternall. This ſecond appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, though the yonger, does with Jacob lie in the ſame wombe with the firſt, in the hearts of all true beleevers. And though it come not out firſt, yet at laſt it obteins the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and birthright, cauſing thoſe that are children of this day, even whilſt they are under the firſt diſpenſation, to abide with God as pilgrims and ſtrangers therein, as all their Fathers were, and by faith to eſpy this promiſed land and heavenly countrey, whilſt at a diſtance and very far off, (Eſai. 33.17.) and to wait for it with patience, in a certainty of hope and ſtedfaſtnes of confidence, till they enter into, and become actuall poſſeſſours of it.</p>
            <p>The operation and effect which this ſecond day of Chriſt appearance shal have upon beleevers, in its very morning brightnes, will render them in their minds like to the elect angels in obeying the law of God, active, powerfull and ſtedfaſt in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93838:7"/> righteouſnes. It will qualify them alſo with a meet frame of Spirit for ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall converſe, whilſt yet in the body, as ſutable aſſociates and conſorts with them in Gods ſervice and worship. And from the powerfull influences that shall deſcend from the intellectuall and ſuperiour part of mans mind, quickned with the warmth and life of thoſe holy Spirits in the hand of Chriſt, the animall or ſouly life and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily nature of man shal be formed into ſuch ſubjection as will by degrees work out a perfect redemption of the body from the bondage of corruption, even in this life, as the needfull preparatory diſpenſation of Eliah, that firſt comes and reſtores all things, before the perſonal appearing of the ſon himſelf. For although he will firſt shew himſelf in the glory of the holy angels, as the bright morning ſtar, in the beginning of this day, yet is he to come forth alſo (in the farther progreſſe of this day) in the glory of his father, and therein to shine forth as the ſun in his ſtrength, after that he hath firſt ſent his angels to gather out of this his Kingdom all things that doe offend, and them which doe iniquity, caſting them into a furnace of fire. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this preparatory work is done by the meſſengers he ſends before him, Chriſt will reveale himſelf from heaven, and by that glorious ſight which he will give of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, chang thoſe that then are alive and remain on the earth, into his owne likenes in ſoule and body, and gather them unto himſelf, as meet conſorts and aſſociates for him in that his glorified ſtate, catching them up to him in that heavenly aire, or Spirit, where they are to be ever with the Lord. In effect, the day of Chriſts ſecond appearance brings upon the ſtage of this world, life from the dead, working and declaring the firſt reſurrection, mentioned (Revel. 20.) which is to continue viſible to men on earth, one thouſand years. The glorious chang which shalbe made in the progreſſe of this day, upon the ſoules and bodies of the Saincts, shalbe ſuch as will no more leave them ſubject to corruption. For over them the ſecond death shall have no power.</p>
            <p>This is another of the dayes of the Son of Man, which ſucceeds the firſt; is to continue a thouſand years and then alſo have its end, upon the ſons making a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and entire reſignation of this his Kingdom unto his Father, that God may be all in all. For during this thouſand years, the ſon in his Kingdom shalbe exalted, as he to whom the father hath committed all judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be executed, ſo that what he binds on earth shall be bound in heaven, and what he looſes on earth shal be looſed in heaven. Whom he will he shall ſlay and whom he will he shal keep alive, as the moſt abſolute Monarch and only Potentate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ever reigned on the earth, to the end that during this ſeaſon and ſpace of time, all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may honour the ſon with the honor due to the father, and in this appearance of the Son ſe the father as in his vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and doe him homage in this his living Image, the Lords Chriſt or anointed one, the man that by God is ordeined to rule the world in righteouſnes, even all the nations upon the earth, during this his day, which immediatly praecedes the day of eternity and laſt judgment, wherein God is to be all in all. The ſon himſelf, after
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93838:8"/> that all things shall have bin ſubdued and ſubjected unto him, shalbe ſubject to the Father that put all things under him.</p>
            <p>This ſecond day of the Son of Man, is that one day knowne to the Lord, not day nor night, but a kind of middle ſtate between that which is corruptible and that which is incorruptible. It is neither abſolutely one or the other, but a mixture of both. And it shall come to paſſe, in the evening of this day it shalbe light, and the paſſage out of this into the day of eternity, very pleaſing and delightſome. It shall diſtinguish itſelfe (as hath bin already intimated) into the 3 uſuall parts of a day, MORNING, MIDDAY, NIGHT.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In its morning beauty and appearance, the Eliah comes and reſtores all things, as is foretold of him, the BRIGHT MORNING STAR, which is to shew to the kings of the eaſt the neer approach of the only begotten Son himſelf, and be to them and all other inhabitants on the earth, the ſigne of the Son mans approaching and comming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the noontide of this day of the Son of Man in his Kingdom, shalbe ſeen the height of the ſunshine of that royall power and greatnes which shalbe exerciſed by him in the capacity of univerſall King over all the earth, the ſeaſon wherein there shalbe one LORD in his owne perſon viſible, and his name one, throughout the whole world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There shall alſo be a declining and evening ſtate of this glorious day, which willingly and cheerfully gives place to the day of eternity, wherein the father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyled shall shine forth and be all in all.</p>
            <p>How fitly does Ezekiel, in the viſion he had of the holy waters, repreſent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe this growing, encreaſing Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, revealed in the Goſpel the light of Gods law that shines forth in the Son himſelf, into the obedience and power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we are to be changed from glory to glory, by the Lord the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The waters iſsued from under the threshold of the houſe eaſtward, on the right or ſouth ſide. Ezek. 47. Their firſt comming forth was by meaſure, the meaſure of a man; and gradually, from the ankles to the knees, from the knees to the loins, from the loins to a river unpaſſable by man, as meer man, in his firſt conſtitution of being.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 2dly then, the ſame waters came forth in a communication above and beyond the meaſure of mans firſt nature, into a river that man may ſwim in without drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or being at all ſubject to die any more, how much higher ſoever it riſe above the head of the naturall man, the firſt Adam. And of this, Noah by faith was aware, who, that he might obtein a ſtate of ſafety from the overflowing flood, (by which al the world, not made beleevers and taken into the arke, were drown'd) obeyed the counſel and command of God, in building the arke and going into it after it was built and ready to receave him. Herein have we a lively type of Chriſts humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, offered up by the immortal Spirit, and brought forth into the life that is from the dead, never to die more, but hath the keys of hel and death committed to him.</p>
            <p>Unto the likenes of this heavenly building and temple of the living God in Chriſts
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93838:8"/> perſon, every true beleever is fashioned and conformed, and is thereby made a fit veſſel to ſwim in thoſe waters of life, ſafely and delightfully, which by riſing up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove al the meaſures and proportions of the firſt world, drowne them, but are the proper element for thoſe that are ſaved, to live in. They are fitted with enlarged hearts and mouths wide enough open'd, to take in and receave thoſe ſtreams and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the emanations of divine bounty and love, how broad or deep ſoever they prove, and how high ſoever they may riſe and overflow. For they have the man Chriſt Jeſus their head, the ſecond Adam, who as their forerunner, is gone before to prepare the way for them, and as the true arke in which are many manſions, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave them into himſelf, that where he is they may be alſo.</p>
            <p>Of what hath bin already ſaid, this then is the ſum. Chriſt is the eternall WORD and ſpeaking power of God, by whom are all things. He is alſo (as hath bin shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the rock of ages, the place of Gods reſt, throughout all generations; the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sabbath, Heb. 4. wherein God finished his works ſo fully to his content, that therein he took up his Reſt, even in the perſon and Spirit of the Mediatour, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which from the beginning of the world hath lain hid in God, who created all things according to the eternall purpoſe which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. Further, This eternall WORD, who is the creatour of all things, viſible and inviſible, being in the Mediatour the image of the inviſible God, does bear the name of the bleſſed Trinity, and ſtamps the impreſſion and character thereof upon all the works of his hands. He is the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and Ending of the creation of God. In the Pſalms and Eccleſiaſtes, God is called by the name of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, as being three, or a threefold cauſe of the being that is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto the creature;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the creatures hidden and ſecret Being, as it ſubſiſts and lives in the mind of God, by way of his purpoſe and decree, and in his fore knowledg;</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this ſeed of creature-being that lives in God, is brought into its naturall and proper form of life, made a part and member of the firſt creation, in a mutable ſtate;</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it is changed and tranſlated out of its mutable ſtate and corruptible fashion, into a form of being and ſtate of life that is immutable; wherein the firſt creation is not deſtroyed or annihilated but conſummated and brought to its final perfection, ſo as to anſwer rhe holy end and deſign of the Creatour, who as the potter hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power over his owne clay, to make veſſels of honour or dishonor as pleaſes him, and in ſuch manner as is exactly conſiſtent with the wiſdom and juſtice of a moſt holy God.</p>
            <p>The nature of men and angels is formed in Gods likenes, wherein they are made with hearing eares, ſeing eyes and working hearts, to attend unto and obſerve the divine oracles delivered to them from the mouth of God, as the law under which they are created, the rule of their life and actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to guide them in the paſſage out of their mutable ſtate into that which is immutable, Gods words therefore doe come forth in the threefold diſpenſation before deſcribed, viſible and intelligible words to their minds or creature-underſtandings, anſwerable to the ſtate they are found
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93838:9"/> in and to the degree and meaſure of their growth, whereunto they have atteined. For there can be no communion or intercourſe between God and man, but by ſuch divine words as are viſible and intelligible to creature underſtanding, ſignifying ſuch things as their eyes may ſe, their ears heare, and that are in themſelvs poſſible and rationall to be obeyed, which all Gods laws to man moſt certainly are. Hence is it, thar John teſtifies of the WORD of life itſelf, that it is viſible and hath bin heard and ſeen from the beginning, being no new commandement, but the old, made viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and intelligible, firſt by the book of the creature; then, by the book of the Scriptures, and laſtly, by the living mouth and heart of Chriſts manhood, aſſumed into perſonall union with the eternall WORD, and thereby made the brightnes of Gods glory, the expreſſe image of his eſſentiall mind, where the viſion at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo plaine to all beleevers, that he that runs may read it. The humanity or flesh of Chriſt ſingly conſidered, is no where in Scripture called the WORD, but at moſt the engraffed WORD. For the WORD is that which is made flesh, and dwells in us, which (though after it was born of a woman and found in fashion as a man, actually partaking of flesh and blood with the reſt of the children, it was ſeen, heard and handled, as the glory or manifeſtation of the only begotten Son of God, full of grace and truth, in the form of a man) was actually in Being and life from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, (which the flesh of Chriſt was not) and was Davids Root, the BRIGHT MORNING STAR, the Lord, the WORD which David in Spirit ſaw, (Pſal. 110.1.) when he ſayd, the Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, till I make thy foes thy footſtool.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, our way wilbe much more open and cleer, to proceed in what we have propounded, as to a ſerious ſearch and purſuite after life eternall. We are hereby naturally lead into the enſuing method, and have our matter pointed out to us for our diſcuſſion and enquiry, in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What are the things that are the ſubject matter of the command delivered to man by the divine WORD and oracles of God, that are the law of his mouth, viſible and intelligible to man by the light and law of nature, the light and law of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the light and law of faith or the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus. And if the matter be one and the ſame, that is declared and made knowne in and under theſe three diſpenſations, wherein is it that they differ from each other?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is that ſtate of mutability which by nature man is brought into? Is his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability loſt or no by the fall, as wel as his natural righteouſnes and purity? may he not yet be changed back againe, at leaſt, to a gradual recovery of his natural righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, yea and yet fatther, into a more excellent ſtate of life and righteouſnes then at firſt he receaved? Is his primitive uprightnes, in kind, recoverable or no? Is it actually and univerſally reſtored to all mankind by the blood and ranſom of the Redeemer, as the means to lead men to repentance, and bring them all to the practical knowledg of the truth, by inwardly cleanſing and purging them from their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93838:9"/> old ſins and ſetting them in the way of that amendment and newnes of life, which God by his law calls for, and commands from all men every where?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it poſſible for man is his mutable ſtate (conſidered as either before or after the fall, according to the degree of reſtoration he does arrive unto) to hear and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the things of Gods law, and ſo to keep the commandements and demean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his actings conformable thereunto, as not to turn from them or let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his heart all the days of his life, untill his tranſlation into his immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly; What is that immutable ſtate in righteouſnes and glory, (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the day of Chriſts firſt appearance, and is perfected by his ſecond) unto which man is fore-ordeined, and through effectuall calling and plantation with Chriſt in his death and reſurrection, is prepared and made heir of in his mutable ſtate, in order at laſt actually to inherit and poſſeſſe it at Chriſts ſeconds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that other day wherein the Son of Man is to be revealed from heaven, which hath its MORNING, MIDDAY, and EVENing alſo, that immediatly precedes the laſt day of eternity, which hath no diviſion or parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, as for the things of Gods law, or matter commanded unto man, which God wills that he should heare, underſtand and obey, (as that on which his life and death depends, and does therefore with all plaines and certainty ſet before him, that ignorance or other excuſe of any kind may not be pretended by him) all is reduced by our Saviour (who beſt knows it) into a very narrow compaſſe, (Luk: 10, 28. in his anſwer to the lawyer that came to tempt him, ſaying, Maſter, what shall I doe to inherit eternall life?</p>
            <p>The queſtion does plainly intimate, firſt, that ſome things were to be done by man, and that by Gods command and inſtruction, in order to obtein or be made heir of eternall life. 2. That ſo doing or working the work of God, the inheritance is ſure.</p>
            <p>Chriſt in his anſwer denies nothing of this, but thinks fit to try the knowledg of the lawyer, and anſwer him according to his owne heart and principles. What is written in the law, (ſayes he) how readeſt thou? The lawyer replies, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all they ſoule, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf. This Chriſt agrees to be the ſum of the things conteined in the commandements of God, which man is to doe, and in the doing and obeying whereof, as he ought and God requires, will make him heir and ſure of eternall life. Therefore all that Chriſt adds, is, Thou haſt anſwered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</p>
            <p>But although theſe few words contein mans whole duty to God and to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet (as by the following verſes does appeare, in the parable of the wayfairing man that fell amongſt theeves) there is more in it then at firſt we are aware of, to perform this duty to God and to our neighbour, rightly, and after ſuch manner as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93838:10"/> is acceptable to God. For, ſo do to it requires faith, that faith which works by love, or which makes us new creatures, giving us the ſight of that man in the perſon of the Mediatour, that hath ſeen God, by whoſe teſtimony we alſo are taught to ſo him, and know that he is, and what he is, even the rewarder of all thoſe with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, who diligently ſeek him. No man knows who the Son is, but the Father, nor who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the ſon will reveale him. He that beleeveth on the Son of God, hath this witnes in himſelf, by the ſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into his heart, and bringing this knowledg along with him, giving us to know him that is true, and that we are in him that is true, even in him that is the true God and eternall life. By ſuch knowledg are we preſerved from idols, and ſetting up ſome other thing in our hearts for the true God, or from ignorantly beſtowing our worship, love, and ſervice upon him.</p>
            <p>He that beleevs not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he beleeves not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which God gives of his Son, when it is plainly repreſented and ſet before his eyes, in ſuch legible characters that he is able to underſtand and perceave the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, even that God hath given unto us eternall life and that this life is in his Son, and is to be had only in the gift of the Son made to us, in a moſt intimate and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable union, which he that hath, hath life: he that hath it not, hath not life. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes short of this, let it make never ſo faire a shew for the preſent, it wilbe ſure to end in death. Hence is it, that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, becauſe otherwiſe we cannot know him as we ought, with ſuch certainty as not to miſtake him for ſome other thing, or ſome other thing for him. And ſo alſo will it be with us as to our neibour or brother; we shall take him to be our neibour and brother, that is not he; and he that is not, we shall account to be him. For, not knowing the very Image and firſt patern, ſet up in Chriſt, our elder brother, and the lowly meek ſpirit in him, which with God is of great price, how can we know the children and many brethren that are to be conformed to him therein? Unleſſe we know and love him that begets, how can we know and love them that are begotten of him? For both he that ſanctifies and they that are ſanctified are all of one, for which cauſe he is not ashamed to call them brethren; thoſe, who if we be are love unto, we thereby know that we are paſſed from death to life. And if we love not, but hate them, ſitting and ſpeaking againſt theſe our brethren, ſlandering our owne Mothers Sons, we are in Gods account no better then Cain, wicked munderers, whatever righteous works we are converſant in according to the letter of the law. Be we as zealous and forward as we will, in offering our ſacrifices and bringing our gifts before the altar, till we be firſt reconciled to our brother, we are directed to leave our gift before the altar, as better not to offer it at all, with a heart which is without that love by which faith works.</p>
            <p>In this ſence are we to underſtand 1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3. If we have al other gifts and good things from God, that are poſſible to be had, and not this love with them, we are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93838:10"/> nothing, we are but as ſounding braſſe and tinckling cymballs.</p>
            <p>The ſaying therefore of Chriſt, do this and thou shalt live, according to his owne reading and underſtanding of the law, is, do this at preſent, by the light thou art under; but give not off, be not ſatisfied til thou come to do it by faith, as a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the knowledge and love which faith teaches and workes, and thou art a true heir of eternall life, and shalt moſt certainly enter into it and poſſeſſe it for ever. Leave thy ſacrifice and thy guift before the altar, in humility and brokenes of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in lowlines of heart, rather then take upon thee to offer it, untill thou have the Son given to thee and art regenerated. For it is better for thee that thou shouldſt not vow, then that thou shouldſt vow and not pay. Keep thy foot therefore when thou goeſt into the houſe of God (or doeſt enter upon the performance of his worship and Service in thy natural, mutable frame of Spirit) and be more ready to heare then to give the ſacrifice of fools: for they conſider not that they do evill, even in their very prayers and duties of divine worship. By faith it is, that the right and ſtedfaſt Spirit is formed, the whole and entire heart which God requires.</p>
            <p>We may then take notice, that there is a twofold reading, preaching, hearing, receaving and obeying of the Word of God and doctrine of his law; the one after a leſſe, the other after a more excellent way: the one, proportiond to the ſight, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and heart of the natural and earthly man, in his mutable ſtate, properly called the law; the other, proportioned to the ſight, hearing, and heart of the heavenly and ſpiritual man, properly called the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>How readeſt thou, ſays Chriſt to the learned lawyer, when he would point out the law in the former ſence; and as to the latter, himſelf is the reader, preacher and worker of it, as he is the Son himſelf and word of faith, which through our being in him, (in whoſe manhood it is as in our mouth and in our heart) is made bread to us, and not only poſſible, but moſt deſireable and prevailingly attractive unto us to do and fulfil after him. In this ſence it is, that Chriſt is the end of the law to all that beleeve; and the law in its firſt kind of teaching or reading, is the Schoolmaſter or teacher that ſends us to Chriſt, and is appointed to keep us under its rule and diſcipline, till it put us into the hands of a better and ſurer guide, which is the Son himſelf, who by the voice of his Servant or meſſenger that he ſends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, gives notice of his comming. But when he comes himſelf, he teaches the way of God more perfectly, the way of knowing and loving God, of fearing him and keeping his commandements, which is the whole duty of man:</p>
            <p>According to this gradual diſcovery and revelation of the mind and will of God in his law, there are ſeveral degrees of growth and age, that man is or may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, in the conformity and obedience that he is to yeild to Gods holy law and commandement;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, that of childhood, ſignifying the ſtate of mans mutability and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93838:11"/> unſtable righteouſnes, wherein he is wavering, liable to be toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, apt to be deceaved;</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtate of youth, or years of diſcerning and ſettled judgment, in thoſe that by faith are ſtrong, and have overcom the wicked one, in whom the Word of God is abiding and hath taken faſt hold and root, importing the life of the firſt reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, (at leaſt, in the principles thereof) over whom the ſecond death is never to have power;</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſtate of fatherhood and moſt ripe years, in thoſe that have known him that is from the beginning, and are one with him, one with the father as Chriſt and the father are one, the church that are in God the father, the Bride the Lambs wife, by whom is made known the manifold wiſdom of God and unſearchable riches of Chriſt, unto the Principalities and Powers in heavenly places, the very holy and Elect Angels. This importeth the life of the ſecond reſurrection in them, and the higheſt aſcent into union and communion with God.</p>
            <p>To all theſe ſeveral kinds of growth, ages, or ſtatures of humane perfection, the word and law of God is a Rule, ſuiting itſelf and commanding the ſame Duties to be performed, (as to the knowledg and love which we are to have and bear towards God and towards our neighbour) accordingly as the heart is principled and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the performance thereof, with a firſt, ſecond or third meaſure and degree of light, and power from God, enabling thereunto. For that which God requires of man in the obedience he is to yeild unto him, is according to what he firſt gives and cauſes him to have, and not according to what he hath not.</p>
            <p>The commandement therefore of God, or the law of his mouth, which conteins in it and requires from man his whole duty, both towards his God and towards his neighbour, is (as to the matter of it) the ſame for the rule of mans walking in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, either in the firſt or ſecond Covenant, being that which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called the law, as wel as that which is called the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is called the law, as it is the divine oracle and righteous command of the ſupreme lawgiver, ſtrictly enjoyning exact and compleat obedience, and ſeverely punishing the leaſt tittle of diſobedience, being diſpenſed in ſuch manner as leaves it to mans liberty and fredom of wil, to hear and obey, or to refuſe and diſobey, at his owne peril, upon the penalties and curſe declared in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tis called the Goſpel or good tydings, as it is the free and gracious conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention or good wil of God, appearing towards man, which God the Mediatour exerciſes, upon the foreſight of what man would doe, as left to his owne freewil in and under the law. For this, in purſuance of his fathers decree, does he cleave unto and lay hold of mans nature or the ſeed of David according to the flesh, reſolving to bring upon the natural frame of mans Spirit, as left to his owne arbitrary choice and freewil, a moſt beneficial and neceſſary change, through which man is prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with to give up and reſigne back againe that firſt liberty of his, into the hands of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93838:11"/> his faithful creatour who firſt gave it, and to truſt him for the reſtoring it in ſuch manner and meaſure back againe, as may be beſt for him and may moſt certainly and infallibly attein the end for which it was firſt given, which was, to fulfil the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Gods law. Accordingly does he receave it in a new, a more excellent and certain manner of hold and exerciſe, wherein it is made impoſſible for him to transgreſſe the law of God by ſinning, and moſt poſſible and free for him to run the race of Gods commandements. Through this new enlargment and fredom of heart, given him by the influencing power of that love which is ſtronger then death, man is ſo bound up in the wil of God, ſo abſolutly ſubjected to what the law requires, as makes him ſure to inherit eternal life. The living and primitive patern of this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is wrought out in mans owne nature, in the perſon of the Mediatour, and ſet before his eyes with an attractive and transforming power, to draw man after him, and transform him into the ſame image, from glory to glory, from the glory of his firſt creation in conformity to the law in Chriſts firſt appearance, to the glory of the new creation, in conformity to the Goſpel, in his ſecond. And thus Chriſt enables his beleeving followers to fulfil the law after him, who came not to deſtroy but fulfil it in the Goſpel. And as ſome are thus changed by the attractive influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Chriſts conſtreining love, others (with whom alſo his Spirit for a ſeaſon ſtrives by the ſame Goſpel manifeſtation of him) are upon their wilful refuſal, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fixed in their diſobedience. To ſuch he becomes a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence; even to thoſe, who after this gracious offer made knowne unto them, doe obſtinately deſpiſe and reject it, preferring their firſt and natural fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Sons of men, to this more excellent fredom and glorious liberty of the Sons of God. In order to make triall of them herein, ſince the fal, Chriſt hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined of the father on their behalf, the reſtoration of that leſſer glory and inferiour liberty of nature (that ought to be reſigned for the greater, that excels and is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main) by the price and ranſome of his owne blood, from whence flowes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional remiſſion of al ſinners, as to ſins paſt, and a free and general reſtoration of them to the priviledg and benefit of their firſt natural fredom and primitive righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, in kind, and in ſuch degrees and meaſure, as is requiſit and ſufficient for the making of ſuch a trial, and rendring them without all excuſe, nothing having bin wanting in him to bring them to repentance and to receave the truth in the love of it. He hath given that former ſort of gifts to the rebellious alſo, that prove enemies and haters of him in the more excellent gifts and priviledges that he offers them alſo in a ſuperiour diſpenſation, which cannot be receaved by them without an obedient ſurrender and loſſe of what already they have receaved from him, at his command. He is a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world.</p>
            <p>Both theſe divine oracles and manifeſtations of Gods will, law and Goſpel, were made knowne to Adam in Paradiſe; the one typed out in the tree of the knowledg of good and evil, fitly reſembling the firſt created liberty and fredom of will man was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93838:12"/> left to the exerciſe of under the law: the other, by the tree of life, placed in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, lively figuring out the better fredom and laſting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, which the Son himſelf makes us partakers of in the Goſpel, as he is the end of the law to al that beleeve, and can be perſwaded to truſt him, as the Goſpel requires.</p>
            <p>In both theſe reſpects it is, that John ſayes, I write no new Commandement to you, but an old commandement, which was from the beginning. As it firſt came forth in law and Goſpel before the fal, it was the law written in Adams heart, and the Goſpel ſet before the eyes of his mind, by the miniſtry of angels, in lively types and figures. This we are to underſtand by the law of nature, by which all natural men shalbe judged, who never have atteined or lived under the hearing of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten law or word of God, given afterwards in the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly: The ſelf-ſame old commandement of God, that is both law and Goſpel, came forth ſince the fall, by divine inſpiration, in the bookes of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, The law was under this diſpenſation, engraven on tables of ſtone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the ten commandements. The Goſpel was repreſented in the ceremonial law of Moſes miniſtry, under the old Teſtament. Then againe, the law is written in the fleshly tables of Chriſts heart, as he was born of a woman, and made under the law: and the Goſpel was repreſented in the two Sacraments of baptiſm and the Lords ſupper, inſtituted during the dayes of Chriſts flesh, the witneſſe whereof is left us upon record in the New Teſtament, as that manifeſtation of Gods wil, which the Son himſelf in and by his firſt appearance hath brought to light. This we are to underſtand by the law of the Scriptures, which are not of private interpretation, nor a propheſy that is come to us by the will of man, but that which holy men ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, for a ſure ground of truth, to be relied upon.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly and laſtly; the ſame commandement or word of God which hath bin from the beginning, is to come forth once more, in and by the ſon's ſecond and perſonal appearance in Spirit, a fiery and living law, call'd in Scripture, the law of the Spirit of life that is in Chriſt Jeſus, which by faith is eſpied and ſeen as the Land of promiſe, into which all true beleevers muſt enter, and where they muſt inherit the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability and eternal life, promiſed; a life from the dead, which thoſe that poſſeſſe, whether in the glory of the firſt or ſecond Reſurrection, though as yet but in the ſeed, shal never die more. The ſecond death shal not have power over them; but all tears shalbe wiped away from their eyes, and all cauſe of ſorrow or fear.</p>
            <p>This is the Son's Kingdom in Spirit, which he receaves and enters upon, by the appointement of the father. He is pleaſed to begin it in weaknes and ſubject it a while to great ſufferings, but will shortly enter upon and continue the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it in power, during the ſpace of a thouſand years, wherein he is to judg the world in righteouſnes, effectually cauſing his wil to be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93838:12"/>
            <p>The law under this diſpenſation, is found as the tables of the Teſtimony laid up in the heavenly tabernacle of Chriſt the Son of Man; a fiery law of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vengeance, in ſeverity without mercy, upon all wilful, diſobedient ſinners.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel under this diſpenſation, is as the throne or heaven itſelf, together with the earth that is made Gods footſtool, or the natural man, ſubjected and brought through faith to Gods foot, in a way excluſive to al boaſting. This is the new heavens and new earth of which the new Jeruſalem conſiſts, that comes downe from God, written in and upon the heart of Chriſts manhood, glorified, and made immutably holy, shining forth as the living Image of God, in a twofold forme, to wit, in the form of a ſervant not only made a Son, which is the firſt; but exalted to a name above every name, and anointed with the oyle of gladnes above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; thats the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt is the WORD (as is above ſayd) that is commanded to a thouſand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. He that was, he that is, and he that is to come, the Almighty: He was both law and Goſpel, in the day or under the diſpenſation of the law of nature; is the ſame, in the day and under the diſpenſation of the law of the Scriptures; and is to come, and wil shew himſelf to be the ſame alſo in the day and under the proper and immediate diſpenſation of the law of the Spirit of life, that is in him. This is the ſpiritual day of the Lord, the thouſand years Jubilee and Sabbath. This third diſpenſation haſtens apace, draw's very neer, and the faithfull and upright in heart beleeve, expect and wait for the comming of the Lord therein, both as an Eliah, in and by his meſſengers and Servants, elect angels and beleeving men (that shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all things, root up every thing that offends, by a ſwift execution of vengeance on evil doers, in the morning of this day) and after that, in his owne perſon, wherein the man Chriſt by whom God hath ordeined to judg the world in righteouſnes, wil shew himſelf as the great King and bridegroom that hath the bride, whoſe mariage he wil gloriouſly ſolemnize on earth, in order to cary her up with him into heaven, upon the expiration of his thouſand years reigne, and the Reſigning up of his Kingdom into the hands of this father, that God may be all in all.</p>
            <p>That the matter of Gods command and mans duty is the ſame, as wel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law as under the Goſpel; and in them both, under all the three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations before mentioned, is ſufficiently cleered and demonſtrated: nor is the difference leſſe perſpicuous, wherein each of them vary one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The law of nature writes the matter of the law and duty commanded, upon the nature and in the very heart of man, teaching and inſtructing him alſo in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goſpel, the new nature, by the miniſtry of angels, in moſt apt, ſignificant types and figures, ſuited to his natural underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93838:13"/>2dly. The law of the Scripture, firſt writes the law in tables of ſtone, and teaches the Goſpel by the types conteined in the ceremonial law, or a ſort of ordinances that are worldly rudiments, being but the shadow of the good things to come, whereof the body is Chriſt. Afterwards therefore, Chriſt coming in the flesh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishes and abrogates that diſpenſation of the moſaical miniſtry, and in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, makes the heart and conſcience of man in himſelf and followers, the fleshly tables, whereon the law is written by the Spirit of the living God. Hereby, a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of holy flesh is wrought in man, like unto the flesh of Chriſt, through the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word. This is the washing of our body or natural man, with the pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the living WORD and Spirit of Chriſt, through the miniſtry of the outward preaching thereof, to the purging and clenſing us from all filthines of flesh. And this is obteined through the vertue and price of Chriſts blood, together with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement and remiſſion of ſins paſt. Under this diſpenſation it is, that by the doctrin of the croſs, ſignified in the Sacraments of baptiſm and the Lords Supper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lively repreſented to the eyes of the very natural man, he is taught the Goſpel a ſecond time, under the Scripture diſpenſation of law and Goſpel. Nevertheleſſe, this teaching yet is short of the glory of God to be revealed in and by Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearance in Spirit, which as it is the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Third and laſt diſpenſation of law and Goſpel, ſo does it differ in excellency and glory, very much from the other two. For it is the fruit of the vine, which Chriſt reſervs to drink with his owne brethren and faithful Servants in the Kingdom of his father, or which his father hath given unto him; that thoſe that have continued with the Son in his temptations and followed him fully in the regeneration, may eat and drink at his table in this his Kingdom, and ſit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael, or the natural and fleshly holy ſeed, jew or gentile, who at that day shalbe found to be but in their mutable ſtate of righteouſnes and life. This is the beſt wine, far exceeding any before receaved in types, figures and Sacraments, being that which Chriſt keeps till the laſt, as that fruit of himſelf the heavenly and true vine, which will refresh the heart of God and of man, or of the divine and heavenly man, as wel as of the earthly and natural man, brought forth in the exerciſe of an immutable righteouſnes, and made after the power of an endleſſe life. The former of theſe is to ſit at Chriſts right hand, the latter at his left, in this his Kingdom and glory, unto which both of them are fitted and prepared by the father, through the lively conformity they are taken into, and made to beare with Chriſt, in his death and reſurrection.</p>
            <p>So much be ſpoken in way of reſolution to the firſt general query of the 4 above propounded, to inſiſt on in this Treatiſe; to wit, concerning the ſubject matter of the law or command of God, delivered to man by the divine WORD and oracles of God, under the threefold diſpenſation thereof, together with the difference of theſe diſpenſations under the law of nature, Scripture, Spirit. The time of the latter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93838:13"/> branch of the 2d diſpenſation, beginning with John the Baptiſts and Chriſts owne perſonal miniſtry in the flesh, is now far ſpent, and the yet more glorious day of Chriſts 2d appearance and diſpenſation in Spirit, is at hand.</p>
            <p>The ſecond General query to be inſiſted on, is concerning the mutable ſtate man was created in at firſt, and remains in, even after the fall, out of which he is again capable to be changed, and either reſtored and regenerated by the knowledg of Chriſt in the Goſpel, or elſe caſt down for ever, into eternal perdition.</p>
            <p>The WORD that hath bin the old Commandement from the beginning, that it may evidently appear to all underſtandings to be the word of Truth, doth branch it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forth (as hath bin declared) into two Teſtimonies or witneſſes, which are both of them the law of Gods mouth. The one conteins in it the doctrine of the law of works, the rule of mans firſt communion with God, in the firſt Covenant: the other, the doctrin of the law and righteouſnes of faith, the rule of that 2d communion which God thinkes fit to take man into in the ſpirit of his Son, which can never be loſt (as the firſt may) but endures to everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Now two Teſtimonies (according to the law) are ſufficient for the diſcovery and confirmation of all truth. Anſwerable hereunto, does he that is Truth itſelf, shine and give forth the light of his glory, whoſe two Teſtimonies may either be joyned in conſortship, harmony and ſubſerviency with and to one another, in the miniſtry and diſpenſing of them, and ſo become a law of life to all that heare and obey them; that new ſong, mention'd Rev. 14.3. ſung before the throne, called chap. 15.3. the ſong of Moſes and of the lamb, ſung together in perfect harmony and agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which no man can learne but the 144000 Virgins, that follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, being redeemed from among men, as the firſt fruits to God and to the Lamb. But now theſe two laws or Teſtimonies of works and of faith, as they may be taught and diſpenſed in difference, diſagreement, inconſiſtency and oppoſition, one unto the other, may become a miniſtry of death, either by ſetting up and exalting the letter above and againſt the ſpirit, or disjoyning the ſpirit from the letter, as that which may be without it and needs no conſortship with it. This is the work of the falſe, deceitful Spirit, the father of lies, and is not of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being the Teſtimonies which from the beginning are commanded by God to be heard and obeyed, no ſooner was man created in Gods image and endued with an immortal, intellectual, rational and ſenſual ſoule, made a free agent, but God ſet them before him, as a meet and capable ſubject, to be made wiſe and happy in the practice of them. The work of the one of them was immediatly written in his heart by the finger of God at his creation; and the word of the other of them, as ſoon as he was put into Paradiſe, was ſounding every wherein his eares, and was expoſed to the ſight of his mind, in the viſible types and ſignes of the Sabbath, the inſtitution of marriage, the tree of life, and by the miniſtry of the holy angels.</p>
            <p>Two things are recorded by Moſes concerning the firſt make and conſtitution
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93838:14"/> of being, given unto man by God, at his creation. The firſt, we find Gen. 1.26, 27. where the counſel is taken by the bleſſed Trinity, his creatours, within them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelvs, ſaying; Let us make man in our image, after our likenes, and let him have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the viſible creation, and be fruitfull, multiply and replenish the earth, ruling over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. So God created man in his owne image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them.</p>
            <p>God is in his being the higheſt reaſon, and the operation or work of his mind is diſcovered and made knowne by the word of his mouth. Theſe two powers in him are reteined in moſt abſolute agrement and uſefulnes each unto the other. Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this patern in great, is man made in little, as to his Spirit and ſoule, with this only difference, that the work of mans mind in reference to Gods law, and his word and outward action in reference to his mind, have not immutability in them, but may diſagree and cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge from their firſt harmony and primitive patern, ſet them in God. The powerfull impreſſion of this patern on the ſpirit and ſoule of man, was ſuch, as in reſpect thereof it is ſaid, God made man upright or perfect, formed his mind in perfect agrement and likenes of operation with his owne mind, and in full conſent and liking of his law, as that which is holy, righteous, Spiritual and good, given for man to obey, as his duty. He diſpoſed him alſo by a natural bent and inclination of mind, to doe good, reſiſt evil, love righteouſnes and hate iniquity. This was the ſtate of mans Spirit or ſoule, as yet ſeperate from his body, and not partaker of that flesh and blood, which was afterwards formed out of the duſt of the earth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing therefore noted concerning mans building or creation, is, that he alſo became a living, ſenſual or animalish ſoule, actually clothed with bodily or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, that God formed for him out of the duſt of the ground; Gen. 2.7. And he breathed into his noſtrills the breath of life, or ſent mans ſoule that was before created in Gods image, into that body ſo appointed and given to it by God, as the earth wherein the ſeed of mans Spirit was planted, and the feild in which it was made to grow, by reaſon whereof man became a living ſoule; that is to ſay, by the moſt intimate union and inhabitation, thus wrought by God between the ſpirit and body of man, there was an awakening and bringing into actual exerciſe, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and bodily nature of his mind, by ſitting to it theſe meet organs. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that which was before in the ſtate of a ſoule ſeparate, an equal and aſſociate to angels, comes by this means to be abaſed and made of little reputation, being brought to a kind of equality with the beaſts that perish.</p>
            <p>And in like manner, as thus the ſpirit of man was after its firſt creation, embodied and made flesh, as a dark shadow of what is done to him, tis ſaid to have bin ſo with the heavens and earth, when created: yea, even every plant of the feild had a ſtate of being, before it was put in the earth; and every herb of the feild, before it grew; Gen. 2.4, 5,</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:93838:14"/>
            <p>Now through the intimate union and conjunction that mans body is taken into with his ſoule, it is made a living, acting, ſpeaking creature, participant with his rational and intellectual ſpirit, and in fellowship there with, meet to have and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe dominion, as God appointed, over every living creature that moves upon the face of the earth. Thus the bodily life of man, became in itſelf as an Eden, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God and the feild that he had bleſſed and made fruitful unto every good word and work, in ſubſerviency and ſubjection of deſire to mans intellectual and angelical part, which by the very order and law of nature, (as having not only priority, but eminency of being) was given to it, both as Lord and husband, a ſuperiour and yet a kind of equal, joyned with it in ſuch a harmonious conſiſtency, that the actings of both natures made up but the compleat and entire Act of mans judgement and will. Thus was man created male and female in the ſpirit and perſon of Adam, before Eve was created, as Gen. 1.27. and 2.28.25. do shew. And he receaved a charg from God, to keep this body in ſubjection to the dictates of his mind, and not ſuffer it to uſurp authority over that part in him which is moſt the man, to wit, the angelical or intellectual part. When God had thus planted the garden of Eden or pleaſure and delight, in this ſpirituall ſenſe, as wel as in an outward and literall, he puts mans ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into it, giving him the keeping, dreſſing and Rule of it, with this expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſaying, of every tree of the garden thou mayſt freely eat; but of the tree of knowledg of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou shalt ſurely die. For out of the ground the Lord God had made to grow every tree that is pleaſant to the ſight and good for food: the tree of life alſo in the midſt of the garden, and the tree of knowledg of good and evil.</p>
            <p>Thus was there a paradiſe without man and within him, a garden of pleaſant fruit, which he might take delight and pleaſure in, and which he was appointed to dreſſe and keep in the order wherein God had delivered it over to him, and to improve it to the end for which he was brought into it by God. And for his inſtruction herein, he was commanded and allowed the uſe of the outward as wel as the inward ſenſes of his mind, with this only caution and Reſtriction, that he should by no means, nor upon any prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whatſoever, hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to or obey the voice of his ſenſual and bruitish nature, how rational ſo ever the judgment of it (which is but flesh) might ſeeme to be, conſidered as in its owne ſingle operation, tempting and drawing off the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent and love of the intellectual part, from the ſtreight rule of its duty, required in Gods law. For the ſpirit of the mind, which is the ſtronger and better part in man, as that which is immortall, remains under the morall and perpetuall convictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, as wel as obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the righteouſnes required in the law of God, the light of which, although it may be ſmoothered for a time, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> never be wholly extinguished, but is that work of the law in the heart that is and wil be unalterably either excuſing and encouraging or accuſing and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the mind, as cauſe is give by every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s works. It is therefore called the conſcience that ſervs in ſtead of a thouſand witneſſes, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is awake,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93838:15"/> does alwayes conſent to the goodnes and righteouſnes that is in the law. By this rule therefore, ſin could not make its approaches, but warning would be given, and to know evil barely in the abſtract, without conſenting to it or becomming one with it, in approbation and delight, was not the thing which God forbade him; but the feeding on it with conſent and delight, upon the beholding of its deſireablenes in the judgment of the outward ſenſes and as it gratified the bruitish luſt and deſire of the flesh, ſo as thereupon to be drawn into a compliance, and induced to make it the Act of the whole man, ſuffering ſin thereby not only to conceave but to be perfected. Hence is it ſaid, 1 Tim. 2.13, 14. that Adam was firſt formed, then eve; And Adam (or the intellectual and ſuperiour part in man) was not in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, or could not be deceaved by ſin, but ſaw cauſe enough to diſſent from and reſiſt it. It was the woman, the ſenſual part, that was deceaved and was in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, being of ſuch power, as not only to entice, but ſo to fetch over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the mind, as to make it the act of the whole man. And ſin being once thus perfected, brought forth death. All this came by mans ill uſe of that liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he was left unto, whilſt under the dominion and teaching of the law of workes, which commits unto man the keeping and Rule of his owne ſoule, upon ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, in caſe of failer, and ſtrictly commands the thing to be done, as that which on all accounts it was mans duty to do, but layes no prevailing reſtraint on him to the contrary, as the law of faith does. The law therefore did in effect shew unto man, that the right way of keeping his ſoule, according as is commanded, is through the prevailing power of faith, whereby man keeps not himſelf but is kept unto ſalvation by his faithful creatour, to whom he has committed the keeping of his ſoule in weldoing.</p>
            <p>This was held forth to Adam in the inſtitution of the Sabbath day, the day of the ſpirit and true Reſt. It is both a day of moſt powerful reſtraint and of greateſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to man; a day, that moſt powerfully and effectually reſtrains man from ſin and all approaches towards it, and that as powerfully binds him up unto God and his ſervice, which is the moſt perfect freedom. Whilſt the bent and inclination of mans will was in its primitive purity, he was left freely to the exerciſe of his owne liking; and on that account, truſted with the keeping of his owne ſoule, in the ſtate which God at firſt deliver'd it over unto him, which being mutable, and not trial-proof, in the time of temptation failed. But let us now conſider a little what it was which God delivered to Adam, with ſuch charg and command to keep, or to reſtore, to him as good as he found it. The Lord committed to his charg and keeping, his precious ſoule and body, and his owne image that was by him imprinted and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thereupon, as his owne coyne and proper goods, to be therefore employed for his uſe, to his ſervice, and according to his will, only. Man receaved himſelf, or came thus out of the hands of God, without the leaſt blemish, and ſo was to keep himſelf without any diminution or waſt, or be exchanged to the profit and advantage of the giver.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93838:15"/>
            <p>Man, thus made in Gods image, with a mind like in operation unto Gods, might very wel be truſted to doe his owne liking. Howbeit, there was hereby planted in him at his creation, a free principle of wel and evil doing, in either of which, he had a capacity to act, but not properly a freedom, by reaſon of the dominion of the law which he was made under, and bound in the obligation of duty to conform unto. In this ſenſe, man was a ſervant to the law and under the authority of it, even whilſt he enjoyed his primitive natural freedom, which conſiſted in the right and priviledg conferred by God upon him, of living according to his owne wil, and being at his owne free motion and diſpoſe, til taken from him forcibly, or that he willingly yeild himſelf up to the ſervice of another, as he did at firſt unto his God, moſt freely and willingly conſenting to have his law exerciſe dominion over him.</p>
            <p>A power then to wil and not to wil at his owne free motion and choice, God gave to man upon truſt or conditionally, that he should be ruled by his law, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep himſelf in al his actings, moſt exactly and uncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gably, in agreement and harmony with that. On this condition, Man was at his liberty to do this or that, which beſt liked himſelf, in al other things. He had power to kil and power to keep alive, in a way of juſt Rule and magiſtratical governement. He had alſo in himſelf a power to doe good and a power to doe the contrary, which is evill; a power to chang and turn away from doing the good he ought to doe, and a power to turn to the evil, he ought not to doe. A capacity or power in him to doe thus, he had from God, and it was not ſin. But his chooſing to exerciſe this left hand branch of his primitive fredom, in turning unto and delighting in ſin, againſt the law of God which he knew, rather then delighting himſelfe in the exerciſe of the right hand branch of his fredom, to good, in obedience and conformity to the law of God, this was his inexcuſable miſcarriage and ſin, let him pretend what he wil or can.</p>
            <p>Now although this were mans natural right, after this manner to be free, as that which in itſelf is lawfull and good, if wel managed, and conducted to the end for which it is given; yet, the being and ſtanding which is given unto man in this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is moſt ſlippery and dangerous, and any long continuance therein, is not at al to be coveted after, when reſtored ſince. For this is not the fredom with which God himſelf is free, or with which Chriſt the Son is free, or does make the true heirs of his Kingdom free with, nor yet is it the fredom of the holy and elect angels, or of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, who yet all are moſt free agents. God himſelf is the freeſt of all; yet he cannot but will good, as of his owne nature bound up unto it. He cannot ſin or lie. Of this fredom doth the man Chriſt partake, and by and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him elect angels and men have their share in it; and in and by the exerciſe thereof, doe inherit the life that is eternall and unchangable.</p>
            <p>Such true freedom does import a powerful binding up and reſtraining of the mind from al poſſibility of doing evil, as evil is taken for ſin and the transgreſſion of the law: and as powerfull a bent and diſpoſition of will, to do what is good, right and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93838:16"/> acceptable in the ſight of God, without any poſſibility of hindrance, reſiſtance or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, in him who wills or does it. The obteining this latter and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fredom, is the end for which the firſt or natural fredom was at all given; God would not have his ſervants in their firſt make, bound up immutably, even to that which is their duty; but by and with their owne free conſent, being in a capacity to diſſent, but at their perill. Neither will he have any debarred and for ever excluded from this firſt fredom, but thoſe that wilfully reject it, that ſo the doing good after the power of an endleſſe life, and the committing of ſin with a hardned and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart, may be found in both ſorts of men, a moſt free and voluntary act, and each receave their reward according to their works.</p>
            <p>By the impreſſion of righteouſnes which man is under from God, as he is made in Gods image, he hath an aptitude, a ſtrong bent, lively inclination and diſpoſition of mind to the right and juſt which is conteined in the law of God, and wherein mans whole duty doth conſiſt. But becauſe (as hath bin ſaid) man is by nature (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this) left at ſuch a liberty, as that he is not by any certain, prevailing and overcomming power over and againſt whatſoever shall make reſiſtance, with held and reſtrained, kept and bound faſt to his duty; at this door, through the weakenes of the flesh, ſin entered, and death by ſin paſſed upon all men, becauſe in Adam the common parent, all men had ſinned.</p>
            <p>This door unto ſin is kept open, ſo long as mans naturall freedom continues with him, either as receaved at firſt, before the fall, or by way of reſtoration through the redeemers blood, ſince, which we shall ſpeake unto in its proper place. That which opens this door, is mans owne luſt, as it is written; Let no man ſay when he is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evill; neither tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his owne luſt, and enticed. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when luſt hath conceaved, it brings forth ſin; and ſin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</p>
            <p>The mind of God is above all temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to evil. The mind of man is not ſo, (though formed in Gods image) whilſt he is yet under the law and its dominion, and hath not atteined unto nor bin brought under grace. So long then as man lives in, and will not part with his primitive, natural fredom, nor reſign it through faith, in exchang for a ſecond gift of it from God, in a better kind and way, he is ſtil under the dominion of the law; and not only accountable for the breaches of it and tranſgreſſions againſt it, but under the inevitable condemning and revenging power thereof, that wil firſt or laſt execute the curſe threatned upon all evil doers. But he that is under grace, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead to the law, being crucified with Chriſt, or faſtned and bound by the power of the death and croſs of Chriſt, with ſuch a bent of mind and hatred againſt ſin, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can alter or chang: and is ſo quickned and made free and a live unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, as nothing can hinder the courſe and duration of it. By this means the door of the mind is ſo fixed and faſt shut againſt all ſin, as it is not in the power of the gates of hel, ever to ſet or break it open more.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93838:16"/>
            <p>In the mind of man, we are to acknowledg (as hath bin already intimated) two parts; 1. the ſpirit of the mind, the ſuperiour and intellectual part, equalizing man with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. 2dly, the ſenſitive and inferiour part, which abaſes man into the likenes and into a kind of equality with the Beaſts; and is indeed, capable to make him a beaſt, yea, actually, and that too generally, does make men ſo. This inferiour part of mans ſpirit, is as the door of his mind, the mouth or inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of its co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſe, inward or outward and in diſtinction from the firſt and ſuperiour power (the ſpirit of the mind) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſcripture, flesh, or the ſenſuall and living ſoule. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 7.25. So then I myſelf, with my mind, do ſerve the law of God: but with my flesh, the law of ſin. So alſo our bleſſed ſaviour, obſerving the fleshly drowſines of his diſciples, that they could not watch one hour with him, at ſuch a pinch of ſtraits as he then was in; the ſpirit (ſays he) is willing: but the flesh is weak.</p>
            <p>This was the luſting flesh in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in paradiſe, whilſt in his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy; and through its weaknes, was the door of the mind ſet open to let in temptation and ſin. For it is ſoon taken and deceaved, and is weak in reſiſting evil. And it is as ſoon weary of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, if the way to perſevere in weldoing, be through the croſſe and all kinds of ſtreights, hardships and diſappointments unto the flesh, even to this fleshly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual part of mans mind. For no ſooner does this come into activity and liberty, by the conjunction and fellowship it is taken into, with the intellectual and ſuperiour part, the ſpirit of the mind, but it is apt to run wild, fly out and grow untamed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, as that which loves not to be accuſtomed to the yoke, and held in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſpirit of the mind, as that is ſubjected to the law of God. It is apt to judg itſelf wiſe enough to make its owne choice, and to truſt to its owne ſingle judgment in all its actings. And in caſe it be croſs'd and not complied with by the dictates of right reaſon in its ſuperiour part, 'tis apt to murmure and be ſullenly rebellious, ſo as to forbeare to do its office and duty to its head and Lord, the ſpirit of the mind. In order to bribe off and gain the conſent and approbation of the ſuperiour and ruling power of the mind, to the way and courſe it deſires to take, it will invent many fair, ſpecious and plauſible pretences; make falſe repreſentations of things, faſcinating appearances, and miſts, to delude and blind the ſuperiour diſcerning of the mind. It will turne every ſtone to obteine its end, ſpreading before the ſpirit of the mind, flattering ſpeeches, as nets and bands, to take and enſnare it, as the ſtrong man Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſerv'd by his Dalilah. This demeanour and practice of the woman, the female and inferiour power of the mind, towards its Lord and husband, the ſuperiour, is moſt lively deſcribed by Solomon, Eccleſ. 7.26. I find (ſayes he) more bitter then death, the woman whoſe heart is ſnares and nets, and her hands bands: who ſo pleaſeth God, (which without faith is impoſſible) shall eſcape from her; but the ſinner shalbe take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by her, he that is a ſinner through unbeleife. The ſpirit of mans mind, by refuſing and reſiſting that offer and work of the ſpirit of God, whereby it should be brought into a moſt free ſubjection and captivity to the law of faith, becomes a ſinner, and ſo comes to be taken by the nets and ſnares, the enticing words and pretences of its inferiour power, and in downright tearmes at length to be wholly captivated and ſubjected under the uſurped commanding influence of that ſenſuall life, it ought to rule over.</p>
            <p>This was the luſting flesh in Adam, as alſo in Eve, before the fall, which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent knew how to tempt and gratify. And ſuch did the weaknes of this flesh prove,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93838:17"/> that it was not able to withſtand or reſiſt the temptation. All that the ſerpent aim'd at, was but to prevaile with this flesh, to think itſelf ſo wiſe and ſufficiently able to move and act by the ſtrength and excellency of its owne ſingle judgment, as that it might ſafely undertake to doe what should be found moſt liking and agreable to its owne ſenſe, and refuſe the contrary, without being bound up to any neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon or holding conformity and agrement in its actions, either with the right dictates of the intellectual part, or with the righteous rule of Gods law. This once obtein'd, Satan had his end. For he well knew, that (this being granted) all the reſt of the evil he deſired to bring into man, and by him into the world, would eaſily and quickly follow. And this was ſo pleaſing and gratifying a baite to the flesh, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a power to direct its owne ſteps, take its owne courſe and way, that it was quickly ſwallowed downe by man, without any due deliberation or pauſe upon the matter, ſuſpecting no hurt as yet, till the luſt that thus was conceaved, came to be finished, and to take along with it the ſpirit of the mind, corrupting and ſeducing that alſo from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, and thereby turning the ſoule from the truth of God declared in his law, to the lie and deceit of Satan conceaved in his crafty ſuggeſtion. Thus by degrees was man brought to worship and ſerve the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, the devil, more then the creator, under whoſe law he was firſt made, and who is the only true God, bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Unto this the Scripture witneſſeth, Rom. 1:22, 23. Profeſſing themſelvs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they became fools: and changed the glory (WORD, or Image) of the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and unto birds, four-footed beaſts, and creeping things. This man came to, by preferring the counſell of a fallen angel, that was gratifying and deſireable food in the eye of flesh, before the holy law and commandement of the living and eternal God, which by the eye of his ſpirit or ſuperiour part of his mind, he ſaw and knew himſelf obliged to the obſervation of.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe, God gives men up to the courſe and full ſway of their owne wills and vile affections, leaving them as bondſlaves to ſin and Sathan, children of wrath and diſobedience, in whom the Prince of the aire ſeats himſelf as in his throne, carrying them captive to his will. Mans continuance in honour and in Gods image wherein he was created, was but a very little while; He quickly found out and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed many inventions, contrary to Gods expreſſe command, written in his mind, as alſo ſignified by the ſundry peeces of the creation, and ſounded out by an audible voice to him, from God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Sin, being (after this manner) the voluntary and free act of our firſt parents, not only conceaved, but finished in the diſobedience by them wrought, and perſected; the wages of it, which is death, they immediatly receaved. For being preſently alienated from the life of God, or the righteouſnes performable by them in that image of God wherein they were created, they became dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93838:17"/> The image of God in man was defaced, changed into an image (in ſome ſort) of the devil. All proneſſe and inclination of the will to good, was forthwith worn off and loſt, upon the fall; and not only ſo, but contrary qualities thereunto poſſeſſed the mind. Thus mans primitive freedom and alacrity to righteouſnes, was turn'd into vile ſubjection and ſervice to the devil, and to all manner of uncleane affections and unrighteous actions.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, this ſudden and unexpected chang in man, (brought about by the ſubtilty and influencing power of the Serpent, by reaſon of the weaknes of the flesh, that diſcovers itſelf in mans mutable ſtate) is not ſuch, but that this deadly wound is capable of healing, and man capable of being thereby reſtored, yea, to be made not only as good but better then he was at firſt, through the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious power of Chriſts ſacrifice and death, which was not only a generall propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and atonement of ſins paſt, but alſo for the ſanctifying and purifying mans nature for time to come, after a more excellent manner through regeneration, then it was by creation. Unto this regenerate ſtate, our firſt parents were called by the voice and doctrine of the Goſpel, ſpeaking to them in and on the ſeaventh day, as the only way and means to have prevented the fall, and kept out ſins entrance upon the nature of man. For when God committed to the keeping of Adam, his owne ſoule, (in the good eſtate wherein he had ſet it, by making man in his image and after his owne likenes) it was not without a moſt ſpeciall charg, to keep this choiſe jewel ſafe and vncorrupted, at the peril of his very life, till chang'd into a better ſtate. This God required him to do, in the uſe of the beſt wayes and means that should be afforded him, even by taking faſt hold of inſtruction, not letting her goe; but keeping her as his life; yea, keeping his heart above all keepings, as that from whence are the iſsues of life.</p>
            <p>To this end was the tree of life placed in the midſt of paradiſe, open to his ſight, that he might have the view of it. And by what was figured and ſignified to him in this tree, was it declared, how the keeping of his ſoule might be by another, even by the Son of God or by the Holy Ghoſt, the ſpirit of truth, dwelling in the heart by faith, which the worldly or fleshly mind does not, cannot receave, but by ſuch an act of abſolute reſignation of itſelf in obedience to the wil of the Son of God, as is more hatefull to it then the worſt of evils. Yet is there no other way poſſible for man to keep his ſoule ſafe for any long continuance, and in the houre of trial, when aſſaulted by the power of darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>The counſel and inſtruction given by the word of the Goſpel in the tree of life, was, that if man found upon full debate and conſideration within himſelf, that he was not like to continue long ſafe in his owne hands, neither could with certainty keep himſelf pure and incorrupt as the law required, that then he would be content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for his guardian and keeper, the Son of God himſelf, in whoſe perſon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and will of man is fixed, ſo as to be the corner ſtone to al the reſt of the heavenly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93838:18"/> and ſpirituall building, even the effectual means to fix and make immutable in righteouſnes both men and angels, that wilbe prevailed with to let him take the charge of ruling and keeping their hearts, in ſuch manner as pleaſes him. This is the only way for man to become free indeed, with a better freedom then that of nature, abovemention'd; even with the freedom wherewith Chriſt himſelf is firſt made free, as he is the ſon of man in heaven, who came downe from heaven before he aſcended up againe thither; John, 3.13.</p>
            <p>This good will and gracious offer of the Son of God, figured out in the tree of life, our firſt parents either neglected and ſlighted, or the way of his keeping them did not pleaſe them, but the ſuggeſtions of Satan were rather hearkned unto, that they might ſafely leane to their owne underſtanding, as the beſt and ſureſt way to keep their ſoules ſafe. This underſtanding, how ſubject it was to be wrought upon and to turn from the truth (though fully convinc'd of it) by the inticing power of the flesh or the ſenſual and inferiour faculties of mans mind, hath bin already shewed.</p>
            <p>Adams ſin then was not only and meerly the transgreſſion of the law, but was mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſomewhat an ignorant rejecting and contemning of the offer of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which was the only ſure means to have tranſlated him (without ſin at all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening) out of his righteous mutable ſtate into an immutability in righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is (and was from the beginning) the tender mercy and long-ſuffering of God, our mediatour and Redeemer, to Adam's poſterity, even in their fallen ſtate, that he not only renews and repeats to man his former gracious offer of Salvation through faith, and the knowledg of himſelf in the Goſpel, but reveales over and beſides this, the means and way, how through faith in his blood, all mankind may be againe reſtored and obteine remiſſion of ſins. All that will, may returne againe by vertue of Chriſts death, into that mutable ſtate of righteouſnes and holines, loſt in Adam, as the common ſalvation and a forerunning diſpenſation to the gift of the ſon himſelf, according to the promiſe. And may it not reaſonably be expected that from the experience of the general love and good will which Chriſt hath thus shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in common towards all men, that they should be eaſily prevailed with to give up their ſoules abſolutely into his hands, through that faith that is more precious then gold, unchangable and never failing, through the power whereof we are made more then conquerours over all enemies, even through him that hath thus loved us with an unchangable and everlaſting love.</p>
            <p>For ſurely, in this God hath greatly commended his love unto all mankind, that when they were without ſtrength Chriſt died for the ungodly, or for all ſinners, whilſt yet in their ſins. Much more then will the current of his love run towards us, being once juſtified by his blood, that through him we may be ſaved to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from the wrath to come. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be ſaved by his life.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93838:18"/>
            <p>This was in effect the voice and doctrine of the Goſpel, which God himſelf prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to our firſt parents, immediatly after their diſobedience, and at the very ſame time that he paſſed his righteous ſentence againſt them for their ſin, Gen. 3.15. In this Scripture God promiſes the ſending of his owne Son in the likenes of ſinful flesh, to condemn ſin in the flesh, and make atonement by the ſacrifice of it, that the righteouſnes of the law might be fulfilled in all thoſe who walke not after the flesh but after the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And moſt expreſsly and particularly is the Goſpel as wel as the law preached by God to Cain, Gen. 4.7. and in him to all mankind, whether ever they reap the ſaving benefit by it or no, as to life everlaſting, any more then he did. To him it is that God ſayes; If thou doeſt wel, shalt thou not be accepted? Is there not a meanes ſufficient and able to bring thee, even thee back againe into reconciliation and acceptance with God, through the ranſom that is paid in Chriſts blood? But if thou doeſt not wel, ſin lieth at the door, that is to ſay, the wages and punishment of ſin. And this yet is not all; For if thou objecteſt, what will it advantage me, to have ſins paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and the breach made up, if there be yet no effectual remedy provided and afforded, to prevent a relapſe into ſin (more fatal and irrecoverable then the firſt fal) and a provoking of God afresh, by reaſon of the unſubjectednes that the flesh or ſenſual part of the ſoule is apt to fly out into, and that prevailingly and finally, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reſtored and anew enlightned ſpirit of the mind, as it fell out with man at firſt? To this God anſwers; it shall be ſubject to thee, and thou shalt rule over it. It shalbe given againe into thy hand and power to ſubdue and bring under, if the fault be not in thy ſelf. Why therefore art thou wrath? and why is thy countenance fallen, as if I were partiall in my dealing, and that my wayes were not equall?</p>
            <p>Q. But what is it, does or can enable cain or any other man ſince the fall, to doe the good God ſpeaks to him of, and avoid the evil he forbids, as alſo to ſuffer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, and that patiently, though for doing wel?</p>
            <p>Anſw: Surely, there are means provided in and by the Redeemer, and the work of redemption given to him the promiſed ſeed to finish, which hath a vertue and ſufficiency to free and ſave all men from the evil, danger and curſe that is come upon them by Adams tranſgreſſion, and to reſtore them againe to their primitive ſtate of purity and freedom, if the fault be not in themſelvs. And when they are brought ſo far on their way againe, towards the end (for which they were at firſt created, and ſince redeemed) that is to ſay, the inheritance of life eternal; then is renewed unto them by Chriſt, the offer of ſaving them to the uttermoſt, paſt all danger of a relapſe, and of giving them that better fredom wherewith the ſon is willing to make them free indeed, unchangably ſubjecting them to the leading and Rule of his ſpirit, cohabiting in and with the heart that is regenerated, making it thereby fit to receave and entertein him, and bringing into it that ſtate of life, over which the ſecond death hath no power.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93838:19"/>
            <p>Hence is it, Chriſt is ſaid to be the ſaviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve. And his will is, that prayer and giving of thanks be made for all men, of all ſorts and degrees, from the higheſt to the loweſt. This is good and acceptable in his ſight, who is the God and ſaviour, that gave himſelf a ranſom for all men, and who therefore will have all men to be ſaved, as leaſt, ſo far as to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the truth, and have the offer of it, in a ſtate of free exerciſe of their will and arbitrary choice, that according as they are prevailed with, either to receave it in the love thereof, or to reject it as a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence, hateful to them, they may obtein eternal ſalvation, or incur the pains of eternal damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet thoſe that are ſaved, are to acknowledg and experience, that it is of meer grace and not of themſelvs, nor of works, leaſt any man should boaſt. But it is wrought by the faith that excludes boaſting, ſetting up ſuch a workmanship or buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the heart of every true beleever, whereby he is created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, that are before prepared and ordeined of God, that they should walke in them. They therefore which truly and ſavingly beleeve in God, will be alwayes carefull to maintein good works.</p>
            <p>Oh the great myſtery of Godlines, that reconciles abſolute empire and ſoveraigne command in one great king! He makes his abſolute dominion to conſiſt with the trueſt, beſt and moſt abſolute liberty of all his good ſubjects, as shewing, that in his ſervice is the moſt perfect fredom. To be left therefore by him, in ſuch a ſtate of fredom, which may either be loſt by us and given up to the will of another, or pluck'd out of our hands by the force of avenging juſtice, (juſtly condemning thoſe to perpetuall ſervitude, that deſpiſe and reject their owne trueſt fredom when offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them) proves in concluſion the certain way to the greateſt ſervitude and moſt miſerable bondage we can bring ourſelvs into. His way is in the ſea; his path in the deep waters; his footſteps are not knowne. For it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. Yet all are ſet in a capacity, to will their owne good or evil; to run their race and shape their courſe, by free choice. But the one ſeed only, that is, Chriſt and his fellow-heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, are the winners and overcommers, that reach the mark, get the prize and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the crowne of eternal life. All others fall short of the glory of God, and by their owne conſent and choice are moſt juſtly debarred from the prize, and for ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the recompence of reward.</p>
            <p>But can the Leopard chang his ſpots? can thoſe that are in a fallen ſtate and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to do evil, ever learn to do good, after the manner Adam did it in his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive rectitude, or in that newnes of Spirit and life, which thoſe that are made free with a better fredom then Adam's was, are created and enabled in Chriſt Jeſus, to worke and come forth in the exerciſe of? Let us hear what the Scripture in this caſe ſayth; Eſay. 1.16, 20. Wash ye, make ye clean: put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes: ceaſe to do evil, learn to do wel: ſeek judgment or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93838:19"/> releive the oppreſſed: judg the fatherles: plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they shalbe white as snow: though they be red like crimſon, they shalbe as wool. If ye be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land. But if ye refuſe and rebel, ye shalbe devoured with the ſword. So Eſay 55.1, 5. Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, &amp;c. Is this only ſpoken to the jews, a people then in covenant, or to all mankind? Se what Peter himſelf was taught to confeſſe and acknowledg in this matter, Act. 10.28. The Lord hath shewed me, that I should not call any man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or unclean, not conceave him to be ſo rejected and laid aſide by God, as not to be in a capacity to have the means afforded him, of being brought to repentance and unto the knowledg of the truth. Conſider alſo the witneſſe given by the Apoſtle Paul, Act. 17. where he preaches the knowledg of God, as of him that made the world and who gives to all, life, breath, and all things. Yea, he made of one blood, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, who were at firſt his offſpring, created in his image, and cauſed them to dwell on all the face of the earth. He was bountiful unto them, even in thoſe times wherein he ſuffered all nations to walk in their owne wayes, doing them good, and giving them rain from heaven and fruitful ſeaſons, that he might not leave himſelf without a witneſſe, and that they by ſuch teachings might ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after and find him, who is not far from every one of us. And although he winked at the former times of ignorance, yet now, ſince the manifeſtation of Chriſt, the promiſed ſeed, in the flesh and in the form and fashion of a man, like unto us in all things, ſin only excepted, he commands all men every where to repent. If they refuſe and prove diſobedient, he will take an account of it in that day wherein he hath appointed the world to be judged in righteouſnes by that man which he hath ordeined, Ieſus Chriſt, who will have no reſpect of perſons; but as many as he shall find to have ſinned without law, shall perish without law: and as many as have ſinned in the law, shalbe judged by the law, in that day when God shall judg the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men by Ieſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We ſe then very evidently, what Gods command is to all men universally, after the fall. It is no new commandement, but that which hath bin from the beginning, which is, that all men every where do repent, and uſe the means provided for them in the promiſed ſeed, to be washed from their old ſins and to come to the knowledg of the truth, or the way wherein to be aſſuredly ſaved and inherit eternal life. This commandement is in effect the ſame it was before ſin entered into the world, ſave only as it now relates to the uſe of the means of being cleanſed from the filth and thraldom of ſin, in order to come to the knowledg of the truth, by hearing the voice of the Goſpel, or words by which we may be ſaved from eternal wrath. Thus was it with the centurion. This teſtimony was given of him, Act. 10.2. that he was a devout man, one that feared God, gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. All this he did, before he had thoſe words preached to him, whereby he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93838:20"/> and all his houſe should be ſaved; Actor: 11:14.</p>
            <p>It is the beginning of wiſdom to be addicted to the feare of the lord, to have a ſtrong bent and affection of heart to keep his commandement, and pray alwayes. This comes by the voice and operation of the law, as repeated and renewed in the blood of Chriſt to us, and miniſtred either inwardly to our hearts by the voice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; or in the powerful miniſtry of the written word, to our outward ears. The former of theſe miniſtries, the gentiles were alwayes capable of, and indeed directly under, who were or are without the written law or knowledg of the Scriptures: the other, the jews, or inhabitants of the earthly Jeruſalem among Jews or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are under, who reſt in the law or written word, making their boaſt of God therein, having the form of the knowledg and of the truth in the law. Both theſe notwithſtanding the chang that may be brought upon them thereby, are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of the law, liable ſtil to the curſe and to a final and total relapſe back againe under ſin and wrath, if they take not very good heed, and ſo may come to be trees twice dead, and be pluckd up by the roots.</p>
            <p>For ſuch enlightned and reſtored ones as theſe may prove to be (as wel of the one kind as of the other) if they shal ſin wilfully, after that they are come to the knowledg of the truth, there remains then to them no more Sacrifice for ſin, but a moſt certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adverſaries; even all the dwellers in that earth, which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, but in ſtead of bringing forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, doe bear thorns and briars, which cauſes them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, makes them nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned. But if the ſame earth, in ſtead of bringing forth thorns and briars, does become ground prepared and made fit to receave the immortal and incorruptible ſeed, by the word of God, which abideth and liveth for ever, and to bring forth the proper fruits thereof with patience, meet for him by whom it is dreſſed, it wil be ſure to receave bleſſing from God, even to be bleſſed with the having of thoſe better things that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſalvation. For he that is faithfull in that which is leaſt, by the ſame grace laying hold on him, and keeping him from evil, becomes alſo faithful in much. And he that is uniuſt in the leaſt, even in the uſe of his leaſt natural fredom, wilbe uniuſt alſo in much, even in the higheſt atteinments, which he can arrive unto, in that his mutable ſtate, and whilſt in his owne keeping.</p>
            <p>Without blood there is no remiſſion of ſins. But through the ſprinckling of the blood of Jeſus, who is our paſſover, whoſe blood ſpeaks better things then that of Abel, the wrath and ſeverity that is by the law is either mitigated, and all procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the way of revenging juſtice for a time (at leaſt) reſpited, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reprieved, upon condition of repentance and amendment of life; or elſe totally and finally remitted. This latter is the caſe of al true beleevers, that are in Chriſt Ieſus by the new and everlaſting Covenant. Thus is that ſaying made good, Iam: 2:13. He shal have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93838:20"/> mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment, on behalf of al that are juſtified frely by grace, through the eternal redemption which Chriſt hath obteined for them. So then, though al have ſinned and come short of the glory of God, he hath not ſo concluded and shut them up in their diſobedience and unbeleif, but in and through the blood of Chriſt he is ready to shew mercy of one kind or other unto all.</p>
            <p>I. Firſt, ſuch mercy as is intimated in that parable, Matth. 18. v. 23. to the end; where the lord at firſt, upon the reckoning he made with his ſervant, pronounced judgment upon him, commanded him, his wife, children and al he had, to be ſold and payment forthwith to be made; (which in effect, was executed in the caſe of our firſt parents) but afterwards, upon the ſervants repentance and humbling himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Lord only patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and promiſing he would pay him all, his Lord was moved with compaſſion, shewed him mercy in looſing him, and freely forgiving him the debt. But this mercy (as appears after) was not that which is called Gods ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſuch as David had, becauſe capable of revocation, upon the ſervants abuſe of it, in shewing no mercy afterwards to his fellow ſervant, which renewed his Lords wrath again towards him, ſo that he delivered him over to the tormenters, til he should pay all that was due unto him. He alſo made it a ruled caſe for al in the like condition, ſaying; If ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, ſo shal my heavenly father (ſayes Chriſt) doe unto you, that is, not forgive you your treſpaſſes. And Luke 13.7, 9. the ſame truth is confirmed in another parable, where the Lord of the vineyard ſayes to the dreſſer of it, behold 3 years I come, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fruit on this figtree, and find none: cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground? He anſwering, ſaid, Lord, let it alone this year alſo, til I shal dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit, well: if not; after that, cut it down.</p>
            <p>This firſt ſort of Gods mercies to ſinners, is conditional, and univerſal, common to the whole poſterity of Adam. He is moved with a general pity and tendernes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in the day of their nativity, when no eye hath compaſſion on them. Yea to ſome of them alſo, he is pleaſed to shew more particular kindnes, ſo that of his owne accord, paſſing by and ſeing them in their blood, he bids them, live; he ſpreads his ſkirt over them, to cover their nakednes, makes that the ſeaſon of his love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to them, teaching them to deny ungodlines, and adorning them with his owne comelines. Notwithſtanding al this, they truſting to their beauty and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes in this diſpenſation wrote in and put upon them, doe fal, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs worſe by their apoſtaſy, then Sodom or Gomorrha. Then the Lord judges it equal, that ſuch righteous men as theſe, when they turn from their righteouſnes (as they finally may) and commit iniquity, should die in it, and alſo hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have all their ſins committed before their converſion or change to that ſtate of righteouſnes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh imputed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though before, God had declared, they should not be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, but buried in oblivion, and that in the righteouſnes which they did, they should live.</p>
            <p>Thus is the Lord many a time ful of compaſſion to unworthy ſinners, whoſe hearts are not right with him, ſo as to be ſtedfaſt in his Covenant; Pſal: 78. He forbears howſoever to deſtroy them, til he hath made proof of them to the utmoſt. Therfore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93838:21"/> turns he his anger away from them again and again, and ſtirs not up al his wrath. He deales with them according to the multitude of his louing kindneſſes, and the variety of mercies that are in him. There are no ſort of ſinners then, who in a leſſe or greater degree, taſt not of theſe riches of Gods mercies, the more of which is shewed to them and abuſed and ſinned againſt, the more is their condemnation heightned. For by ſuch demeanour, they do crucify to and in themſelvs the ſon of God afresh, and put him to open shame, counting the very blood of the Covenant, wherewith they have bin ſanctified, an unholy thing, and doing deſpite to the ſpirit of grace.</p>
            <p>With theſe kinds of mercies Chriſt is the ſaviour of al men, a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world. And thus God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not imputing their ſins; and he not only commands, but beſeeches al men to be reconciled to him, to lay hold on his ſtrength, and be at peace with him, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receaved in vaine the grace he hath begun to beſtow upon them.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe his common mercies, declaring his good wil to al men, as not taking pleaſure in the death of any ſinner, he hath alſo his choice and peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and loving kindnes for ſome, as it is written, I wil give ye the ſure mercies of David, abſolute, irrevocable gifts. Thoſe that after this manner find favour in his eyes, have the remiſſion of their ſins confirmed with an oath, that their iniquities shal never be remembred any more, and that his mercy towards them shal never faile, he will not leave nor forſake them. My mercy wil I keep for him for ever more; my Covenant shal ſtand faſt with him. His ſeed alſo wil I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the dayes of heaven. Their transgreſſions shal not hinder the good I have purpoſed to them. For notwithſtanding their unworthines, for which I will chaſtize them with the rod and with ſtripes, yet my loving kindnes wil I not utterly take from them, nor ſuffer my faithfulnes to faile. My Covenant wil I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I ſworn by my holines, that I wil not lie unto David, (the man that is after my owne heart) nor to his ſeed after him, that walk in the ſteps of his Spirit and faith. Pſalm 89. I will build him a houſe, and eſtablish it for ever, by an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure. In this moſt gracious promiſe David acknowledges al his ſalvation to be, and all his deſire; 2 Sam: 23.5.</p>
            <p>Mercies of both theſe kinds are with God, who is rich, and plentiful in goodnes, having none like him. He is a God that pardoneth iniquity and paſſeth by the trangreſſions of the remnant of his heritage. He reteineth not his anger for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in mercy. He will turn againe, he wil have compaſſion upon the remnant of his heritage, ſubdue their iniquities, and caſt al their ſins into the midſt of the ſea. But as to the reſt of mankind, that prove diſobedient, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved the grace of God (the former ſort of mercies) in vaine, that word shalbe made good upon them which the Lord ſpake concerning the Sons of Eli, 1 Sam. 2.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93838:21"/> 30; I ſayd indeed, thy houſe and the houſe of thy father should walk before me for ever: but now be it far from me; for them that honour me, I wil honour; and they that deſpiſe me, shalbe lightly eſteemed. This shews what condition was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, upon which God made that promiſe.</p>
            <p>Since then by man came death, by man alſo is come life and reſurrection from the dead. And this is revealed to fallen man, in the good tydings of the promiſed ſeed, who (as hath bin ſayd) declares himſelf the ſaviour of al men, but eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve. He hath a common ſtock and Treaſury of goods and ſpiritual gifts, wherewith the whole world (more or leſſe) is watered, fed and enriched by him. For he cauſes his rain to deſcend and ſun to shine on the unjuſt as wel as on the juſt. But over and beſides all theſe, whether natural or ſpiritual gifts, he hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible and undeſiled, that fadeth not away, the heavenly and true Treaſure which he gives and commits to thoſe who are by him found or rather made faithful in the little that at firſt is truſted to their uſe and management, Luk: 16. And he cauſes them to poſſeſſe it in an hereditary right, as coheirs with the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, children of the promiſed Spirit, either in the ſingle or double portion thereof.</p>
            <p>This is he that is appointed by the father, to turn men back againe to God, out of their fallen, ſinful ſtate, by a repentance, not to be repented of. By his name and faith in his name, whoever calls upon him, shal be ſaved from his ſins, and be ledd on in the way to life eternal. He was made a ſacrifice or ſin-offring for us, that we might become the righteouſnes of God in him. Thus God found it conſiſtent with his jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice as wel as his goodnes, to grant remiſſion of ſins to al that should ſeek unto him for it, by the mediation of his Son, who is the righteouſnes of God, that without the law is manifeſted, being witneſſed unto by the law and the Prophets, to and upon all that beleeve, without reſpect of perſons. Him hath God ſet forth and made manifeſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, declaring his righteouſnes to be that which procures remiſſion of ſins and Gods paſſing over al that is paſt, in the way of his forbearance and reprieve, til farther trial and proof had of the whole world, as wel as to be abſolutly and immutably the juſtifier of al that beleeve in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, with the faith that abides trial, and by which the world is overcome.</p>
            <p>The difficulty which yet remains, is that which the Apoſtle Paul was ſenſible of, Rom. 10. where he affirm's that whoſoever beleevs in Jeſus, shal not be ashamed, and that there is no difference between the jew and the Greek, becauſe the ſame Lord over al is rich unto all that cal upon him; (Whoſoever therefore, being ſenſible of his lack of wiſdom, shal cal upon his name, he shal not be upbraided nor ſent away empty, but have the means revealed to him, whereby to make him wiſe unto ſalvation) But how shal they cal on him, ſaith the Apoſtle, in whom they have not beleeved? and how shal they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? and how shal they hear without a preacher? and how shal they preach, except they be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93838:22"/> ſent? and who are they that God ſends with theſe his glad tydings, the very feet of whom ought to be beautiful in our eyes, and the report they make, and witneſſe they beare, moſt acceptable to us? The anſwer there to theſe and the like queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is very short. So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God: not by that word, whoſe ſound goes forth into al the earth, and into the ends of the world. When the Lord gives forth this general word or command, he hath a great army of preachers, ready to be ſent on his meſſage. Great is the company of thoſe who are ready, willing, and have an aptitude in them to publish it. This David wel knew, when be gave a deſcription of three ſorts of preachers, within his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort, he mentions Pſal. 19. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth his handy work, even in the mediatour, as in them he made a tabernacle for the ſun, which as a bridegroom comming out of his chamber, shines more and more, unto a perfect day. His going forth is from one part of heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; ſo that there is nothing hid from the heat (and light) thereof. Thus alſo God brought forth Abraham, shewed him the ſtars of heaven, and ſayd, ſo ſhal thy ſeed be, preaching Chriſt to him, in and by the ſight of thoſe heavenly bodies. And Abraham beleeved, and it was accounted to him for righteouſnes. In like manner were the wiſe men of the eaſt brought to the knowledg of Chriſt in his kingly power and office, by the ſight give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them of his ſtar, a ſtar that made him known to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and went before them to conduct them to a ſight of him in his owne perſon, which is al that this ſort of meſſengers or preachers of Chriſt can do. Thus the book of the creatures, by Gods ſpecial Ordination and inſtitution, in the way of types a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d figures, through the miniſtry of angels, does teach and preach the righteouſnes of God, which is in Chriſt, in order to lead us to the perſonal ſight of him, that we may in the end hear himſelf ſpeak. After this manner the righteouſnes of God in Chriſt, is and may be manifeſted, without the law or written word.</p>
            <p>Secondly; In the ſame Pſalm he mentions another ſort of preaching and teaching of the knowledg of Chriſt; and that is out of his law, the law of his written word, the miniſtry whereof is for the converting of mens Soules, and it is a ſure Teſtimony, that makes wiſe the ſimple: more to be deſired then gold; yea, then much fine gold: ſweeter alſo then hony, and the hony-comb. The righteous ſtatutes and judgments of God ſignified in his written word, reioyce the heart, and are true and righteous altogether. His commandement is pure, enlightning the eyes. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the law or command of God, thus manifeſted, Chriſt ſayes, ſearch the Scripturs, whoſe true office is not only to revive and inſtruct you in that law that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in your hearts at the creation and loſt by the fal, but to ſend you to me alſo, that by obteyning a perſonal ſight of me in ſpirit, you might be farther inſtructed in the knowledge of me. But ye wil not come unto me, that ye may have life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, (Pſ: 8:2:) David shews that there is another ſort of preachers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93838:22"/> that God ſends as labourers into his harveſt, ſaying, out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings haſt thou founded or ordeined ſtrength, becauſe of thine enemies, and that thou mighteſt ſtil the enemy and the avenger. Theſe babes and ſucklings Chriſt himſelf interprets and expounds to us (Luke 10.21.) firſt, of thoſe his ſent ones, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty in number, which he immediatly authorized and qualified by commiſſion from himſelf, ſending them two by two before his face, as his harbingers and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners, into every city and place whither he himſelf would come. Secondly he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it of thoſe babes and children of the fathers begetting, to whom he reveals thoſe things which he had hid from the wiſe and prudent. One of theſe babes Peter is acknowledged by Chriſt to be, (Mat. 16.17,) when he called him the rock. Chriſt hereupon owned him as one of the bleſſed ſeed, who had that ſight and knowledg of Chriſt in ſpirit, given to him, which none but the father could reveale. Flesh and blood could neither give nor receave it. For ſuch knowledg of Chriſt requires a ſpiritual eyeſight and diſcerning, peculiar to theſe children and babes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers owne begetting, the plantation of his owne right hand, of whom Chriſt ſayes, (Mat. 13.16, 17.) Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear. Verily, I ſay unto you, many prophets and righteous men have deſired to ſe thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them: and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them. For all things are delivered to me of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and no man knoweth the ſon but the father: neither knoweth any man the father, ſave the ſon, and he to whomſoever the ſon wil reveal him.</p>
            <p>This ſight of the Father and Son, in their mutual relations to, and fruitions of each other, gained by the perſonal ſight of Chriſt in ſpirit, is mentiond by Paul, 1 Cor. 9.1. when he ſays, Am not I an Apoſtle? have not I ſeen Chriſt? or, am not I one of thoſe that by the ſight of Chriſt in ſpirit and the revelation of the Son in me, have receaved grace and Apoſtleship to the obedience of faith among al nations, for his name? Theſe are the pure in heart and poor in ſpirit, that are taught after this moſt excellent manner to ſe God and have the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, in order thereby to be made miniſters and witneſſes, as wel of the things at firſt ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by them, as of thoſe alſo wherein afterwards Chriſt yet reſerus himſelf farther and more fully to appear unto them. Theſe ſpeak the things which they know; teſtify that which they have ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether their witneſſe be receaved or no, having themſelv; firſt heard the record that God gives of his Son, and ſet to their ſeal, that God is trues</p>
            <p>This is the threefold cord, the lines whereof are ſtreched out over al the world and to the ends of the earth, by the quickning power of the living WORD. He rideth upon the heaven of heavens of old. Loe, he ſends out his voice in each and in al theſe his diſpenſations, and that a mighty voice, sharper then any two-edged ſword, peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, even to the dividing aſunder of ſoule and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, a diſcoverer of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature, that is not manifeſt in his ſight. All things are naked and open to the eyes of this our great ſaviour and redeemer. And as he ſpeaks immediatly by himſelf, by the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93838:23"/> voice of his owne mouth, ſo does he alſo ſend out his voice by his hoſts or armies of angels, thoſe miniſters of his, which doe his pleaſure and ſignify his commands to others, which they receave, as always attending and hearkning to the voice of his word.</p>
            <p>The word therefore, as at firſt it is given in a fore-running and preparatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to the Sons appearance in his owne perſon, is called Heb. 2.2. the word ſpoken by angels, the command whereof is ſo ſtedfaſt, that every transgreſſion and diſobedience thereof, receaves a juſt recompence of reward. By the Rule and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy and elect angels, exercis'd according to his word and law, was God the Mediatour Pleaſed to put and keep in ſubjection the whole firſt creation, even man alſo, who in his firſt and mutable ſtate, is the cheif and higheſt member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, next under the angels themſelvs.</p>
            <p>By means of this angelical miniſtry and Rule under Chriſt, or in the hand of the Mediatour, the righteouſnes of God, wrought out in the perſon of the redeemer, is made manifeſt without the law, to the gentiles that are without law, that is, the knowledg of the Scriptures or written word; as alſo by the law, to the jews, that are in and under the teaching of Gods written oracles, and do or may there find the witneſs and manifeſtation thereof. In and by theſe it doth appear, that Jeſus Chriſt died for our ſins and is riſen again for our juſtification. By jews in this caſe we are not only to underſtand the ſeed of Abraham according to the flesh, but thoſe alſo among the gentiles who are planted into the ſame good olive tree, Chriſt, on the ſame tearms of mutability as they were, liable to be broken off again; and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that are after the ſpirit, true heirs according to the promiſe, who are in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner under this diſpenſation and teaching, til the ſeed himſelf come and take them from this Schoolmaſter, in order to bring them under the moſt lively effectual tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and inſtruction of his owne mouth, and by his owne perſonal appearance in ſpirit to them, either as the day-ſtar ariſing in their hearts and giving forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his firſt appearance in his owne face as he is the Son of man, in the form of a ſervant, and fashion of the firſt Adam, made immutable; or 2dly, as the ſun in its ſtrength, breaking forth in their ſoules that are gathered to him, appointed and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to be with him in the Kingdom of his father, and admitted to the peculiar priviledge of beholding his glory in the face of his moſt exalted and heavenly manhood, as he is the only begotten, lying in the fathers boſome, he that is above all. What he hath ſeen and heard in the beholding of the fathers shape and very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, that he teſtifieth; but no man receaveth this his teſtimony, that is but a meer man and no more; For it is not, it cannot be conveyed or communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, but with unſpeakable words which it is not poſſible for man in the ſingle capacity of his firſt nature and make, though become immutable, to receave or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo much doe they ſurpaſſe all the knowledg as wel as expreſſion of meer man.</p>
            <p>Under the voice of this threefold miniſtry, God the mediatour (who is the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93838:23"/> of heaven and earth, the maker of them and all therein) hath made of one blood al nations of men for to dwel on the face of the earth; hath diſtributed to al of them, and determined the bounds of their habitations, as alſo the different and proper means to bring them back to himſelf, by repentance from dead works and faith towards the living God. He hath awakened that light in every one that comes into the world, that shal move and cal upon them at ſome time or other, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſundry concurring providences, to ſeek the Lord, if haply they may feel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him and find him, who is not far from every one of us. It ought not then to be a thing incredible with us, but that by theſe means proviſion is made by God in Chriſt, and care taken, not only for the reſtoring of man againe unto that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and purity of nature which he loſt, and to the exerciſe of that kind of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil which he enjoyed at creation, but yet farther, to regenerate and beget him into a more excellent fashion of being and heavenly frame of Spirit, in and by which the end of his firſt creation is fully anſwered, and the law of it accomplished. Of this we shal now in the third place proceed to treat, by way of anſwer to</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third generall Query, which is this.</p>
            <p>In what ſence is it poſſible for man in his mutable ſtate, conſidered either before or after his fall, (according to the degree of reſtoring, healing grace, which he does or may arrive unto) to hear and obey the things of Gods law, without turning from it finally; and, in ſo doing, to grow up out of his mutable into his immutable ſtate, and be made heir and poſſeſſour of life eternal?</p>
            <p>To underſtand this the more plainly and diſtinctly, and to prevent prejudices and miſtakes, we shal diſcuſſe this ſubject under theſe 4 particular enquiries following, as branches of this 3d maine point and general query.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether was man at firſt created in a capacity of being, and aptitude of mind, poſſible to obey and fulfill the law of nature, ſo to as anſwer the end of his creation; til brought under a ſecond work of Gods hand, call'd the new creation, and thereby caſt into a new mould and frame of being?</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether man by ſin, be ſo unmade againe and corrupted, ſo diſorder'd and diſabled, that by the bleſſing and vertue of Chriſts blood, and the proper and fit means that by the father are put into the hands of the Mediatour, he is not in a capacity and poſſibility, notwithſtanding his loſſe by the fall, to be reſtored and made able againe to obey Gods law, with the ſame kind of ability God gave him at firſt? And upon ſuch reſtoration, is he not obliged to ſet about it? at leaſt, to shew his good will, and ſyncere inclination of mind there unto, according to the meaſure of the ability he receaves?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How was man to employ and make uſe of his naturall ability and ſtrength, given for the performance of Gods law? and according to what rule might or ought he to have walked with God, either before or after the fall, which would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly guide and unmoveably keepe him in the way to eternall life? a way, which is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93838:24"/> called the way of holines, ſuch as the uncleane paſſe not over, and the wayfaring men though fooles, cannot, or shall not erre therein, and at the end whereof is immortality and eternall bleſſednes?</p>
            <p n="4">4. How comes man in a judiciall manner to be hardned by God, and made a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of wrath, fitted and appointed to everlaſting deſtruction? And when is it, that he shalbe denied any farther benefit by the Sacrifice or Chriſts death, and no more permitted to change his mind and turne from his evill wayes, though he should ſeek it with teares, but be in a certaine expectation of the unquenchable flames of Gods wrath, ordeined for the punishing and devouring of all fixed and impenitent ſinners?</p>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe enquiries.</p>
            <p>The creatour did at the beginning put a created ability and principle of motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the creature. But the ſtrength and power of this firſt impreſſion is not ſufficient for the continued motion of every reſpective creature in its kind, but a perpetuall concourſe and cooperation of the creatour is needfull thereunto. Then doubtleſſe man, who was made in Gods image, a rationall and free agent, the maſterpiece of the viſible creation, ought not to thinke himſelf exempt from ſuch a dependance, nor to covet or deſire to be made perpetuall, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch tearms as would in effect dethrone his creatour and make more Gods then one. The end for which man was at all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was to be perpetually moving in love and ſervice to his creatour, as a veſſel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with meetnes for the uſe of his Lord, in whatever he should be comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by him, for the advancement of his prayſe and glory. Now, as loue is the end and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo is it the firſt and cheife principle out of which all true obedience to the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt proceed, and a duration and perpetuity in this loue and duty is abſolutely neceſſary to mans hapines and continuance in Gods favour and good liking. For untill a man keep Gods commandements out of this principle, and be ſure of its unchangeablenes, he neither can be ſayd to walke in that Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or agreement with God, nor ever be ſure of keeping the condition of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, upon which God promiſes to be his God, and to be and abide in loue and communion with him for ever. And it is moſt unqueſtionable, that the Lord will faithfully performe his promiſe and his oath, the two immutable things wherein he cannot lie. The only doubt is, whether man in this firſt make and frame of mind, be able to performe the duty required of him. Every benefit requires anſwerable duty. Gods bounty then to man in giving him his being, creating him in his owne image and likenes, muſt needs lay a ſtrong obligation upon him to loue God with the love that he requires. And if this love be made by God a neceſſary condition of mans obteining eternall life, it is certainly poſſible for man to performe this condition, even, to loue the Lord his God with all his heart, ſoule, mind and ſtrength, either in the power of what he hath, or of what by the ſame gracious and liberall hand of God he may be made to have. For an impoſſible condition is all one with a negative, as if God should ſay, that eternall life and bleſſednes is utterly impoſſible and altogether vnatteinable for man.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:93838:24"/>
            <p>The nature of man is moſt drawne and commanded by love. This is that which ſwayes and carries it in its motions after the object which it purſues. Now the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance which God gives of himſelf in his Son, (the image of the inviſible God, the brightnes of his glory and expreſſe character of his perſon) is the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deſireable object that can come into the mind of man, for his fruition and inheritance. And he is not only lovely in himſelf, but full of love to man. He hath ſuch love in him to mans nature, as he hath not to any beſides; no, not to the angels. For he took not on him the nature of angels, but the ſeed of Abraham, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by came to be knit in perſonall union with the only begotten Son of God. And yet farther, the love of God in Chriſt towards men is moſt largly and liberally diffuſive, to the filling all thoſe that doe become willing receavers and enterteiners of it, with its owne fulnes and unſearchable riches of divine treaſure, shewing itſelf not in word only, but in deed and in truth, to all thoſe that are taken into cohabitation with it, as the habitable part of its earth. The cords of this love are the cords of a man, attracting by arguments exceedingly adaequate and ſuited to the reaſon and underſtanding of man. Where lies then this great myſtery, that it should be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for man to continue in the love which God commands and declares, as the law he is to obſerve and performe, upon the ſevereſt penalties of his diſpleaſure? Is it not rather indeed a groſſe miſtake for any to thinke or ſay ſo? And are we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conclude and affirme, that it was not only poſſible for man to have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this great and comprehenſive duty of continuing in the love of God, (which is the fulfilling of all law) before his fall, but is ſo ſtill, by ſuch reſtoration of ſtrength and ability as men doe receave by the vertue of Chriſts death and reſurrection?</p>
            <p>Man in his firſt creation was furnished with an ability to be his owne keeper in that righteous and good frame wherein he came fresh and lively out of Gods hands, with which he girds himſelf and goes whitherſoever he will. He was created unto good workes, that he should walke in them: he had the enlightning and quickning influence of Gods ſpirit to aſſiſt and direct him therein. Yea, he was ſo intimately ioyn'd with the Lord the ſpirit, in love, likenes and agreement, that it may truly be ſayd, his ſoule was (as it were) a part of his, joyned and continued to him as the habitable part of his earth, the temple which he built for himſelfe to dwell in. And muſt it not needs be very irkſome and painfull, to depart, be cut of, diſioynted and ſeparated by our iniquity, from him that is our life? But as man hath thus a righteous and reaſonable ſoule, which ought to be guided by the mind and law of his God, ſo hath he alſo a power of girding and turning himſelf, according to the free motion of his owne will. He hath in his ſoule a changa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble principle, which can move and conclude either way, to good or evil, according to the differing report and repreſentation that is made to him, by the one or other part of his mind, that is, his intellectuall or ſenſuall natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, of both which he is compoſed, as hath bin shewed. So then according
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93838:25"/> to the arguments given by theſe different parts of his compoſition, on the one hand or on the other, (being furnished with a competent meaſure of divine light to diſcerne and conclude aright, as to the way he should goe) God leavs him ſo far forth in the hand of his owne counſell, as to be at liberty to chuſe and determine within himſelf, as it shall ſeem beſt to him. In this vnconſtant and moveable eſtate of man, this dividednes and wavering of mind, inclinable to good, and alſo to evill under the shew of good, man being left free and without conſtraint, what is it poſſible for him to doe? can he love the Lord his God with all his heart, ſoule, mind and ſtrength, and his neighbour as himſelf, and can he continue ſo to doe, unchangably and perpetually?</p>
            <p>The anſwer very breifly may be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is poſſible for man to be perpetually moved in and by that love to God, which is required by the law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is poſſible for man, conſidered either as before or ſince the fall, to move himſelfe in the performance of this his duty, for a much longer continuance, then he shews himſelf willing and inclinable to do it, in his mutable ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It muſt reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that while man reteins ſuch a changable principle and fountaine of action in him, as the freedom of his owne will, and to be in his owne keeping and at his owne diſpoſe, his obedience to Gods law and his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him muſt needs be (as God him ſelf complains) at an all-adventures and without any ſtedfaſtnes in his Covenant. But he that as ſingle and at his owne diſpoſe, in the freedom of his owne will, cannot keep himſelf firme and ſtedfaſt in the performance of his duty, may ſo yeild himſelfe to be bound up in the will and motion of another, who is unchangable, that he may be kept in the power thereof, unmoveable and free from all danger of departing or turning aſide to the right hand or to the left, from the holy and ſtreight way of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And this ſeeming bondage to the will of another, is the trueſt, greateſt and moſt abſolute freedome, being that which falls to mans share as he comes to be actually united with Chriſt in the band of the choiceſt and moſt excellent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage union.</p>
            <p>We may then ſafely conclude, that it was poſſible for man, by the ability and ſtrength of nature given him before the fall, to have ſtood and continued longer in his duty then he did. For before any danger appeared of his diſcontinuance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or that any temptation thereunto diſcovered it ſelf, a way was ſet open to him in the tree of life, (wherein he was taught how he ought to reſigne up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the teaching and will of another) whereby ſuch a change might have bin brought upon him through a new creation, and the comming of the ſon of God to dwell in his heart by faith, even that faith which workes by a love ſtronger then death, as would have rendred him unmoveable in his duty and love to God.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs then be acknowledged to be mans owne fault through unbeleife
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93838:25"/> to reſiſt and harden himſelf againſt that working of the holy Ghoſt which brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us the pangs of the new birth, as a needfull preparation thereunto. This was the folly of Ephraim, that unwiſe ſon, who ſtayed long in the place of the breaking forth of children, (Hoſea 13.13.) as having no mind to endure the pangs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the birth of the immortall ſeed. This was great folly in our firſt parents, but it is far greater and more dangerous in any reſtored but to ſome graduall exerciſe of the like ability ſince the fall, when proof hath bin made by man at his beſt eſtate, in his primitive purity, what this firſt ability and ſufficiency of nature does amount unto, as to the keeping out of ſin. For what can the man (in this caſe) doe, that comes after the king? If the armour with which our firſt parents were armed againſt the great Goliah, did (upon experience) faile them, ſurely though it be prepared to be put on againe by their poſterity, and attempted anew, never ſo often, it is and wilbe found alwayes beſt for us with David to forbeare making uſe of it with any confidence in ſuch ſelfſufficiency, and to reſort to the more ſure and effectuall weapons, mention'd, (2 Cor: 10:4: and Eph. 6:11, 17.) and to put on the whole armour of God; to arme ourſelvs with the ſame mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus, that may make us inclinable and ready ſo to ſuffer in the flesh as to ceaſe from ſin, or ſo to crucify the flesh by the powerfull operation of this heavenly mind in and upon us, as thereby to put an end to all the motions of ſin in our fleshly and ſenſuall part, which is the door by which at firſt ſin entred.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the ſecond particular enquiry, in order to the clearing up the third generall Querie in this diſcourſe, concerning the loſſe and deprivall (which happened unto man through his ſin and diſobedience) of that naturall ability and aptnes of mind which he had in his primitive purity to love and ſerve God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his duty. And how far is man (by the vertue of Chriſts blood, duly applied to him) capable of reſtitution into the exerciſe thereof, ſo as to be once more put upon the proof and triall, whether in the day of temptation he will hearken to the voice of the goſpel, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which purifies the heart from all filthines of flesh and ſpirit, not only from the blood or naturall pollution, from which before it was not cleanſed, but alſo from all thoſe things whereby man could not be cleanſed and freed by the law of Moſes, by the beſt naturall ability and ſtrength receaved by him in his firſt creation, or renewed and revived in him ſince?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, we shall as little as may be repeat what hath bin mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but rather refer to it. Only here is the proper place to reaſſume the purſuit of what was but lightly touch'd before, concerning the conditionall Covenant, made by God with Cain, after the fall, which is neceſſarily implied Gen. 4.7. and may ſafely be concluded on;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Cain owned himſelf a viſible worshipper of God, and brought of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93838:26"/>2. Becauſe God in effect ownes as much himſelf, when he ſpeakes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if thou doe well, I wilbe as good as my agreement with thee, thou shalt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. But if thou doe ill, know that the Covenant I have made with thee, is but conditionall, and workes wrath upon thy diſobedience, whereby the punishment of thy ſin will haſten apace upon thee, and be neer thee, even at the door. And that thou mayſt certainly know, thou wilt be without all excuſe for thy diſobedience, if thou perſiſt in it, doe not thinke to lay the fault any where but in the free motion of thine owne will, which thou art reſtored to the exerciſe of. For although through the fall, thy luſting proud flesh and ſenſuall part of thy mind hath gotten the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and uſurped authority over thy intellectuall and moſt purely rationall part, it shall be ſubject to thee againe, as it ought by the law and order of nature. For thou shalt be more and more renewed into a ſtrength and ability to rule over and keep it to its duty, if the fault be not in thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>This conditionall Covenant with the benefits of it, thus renewed between God and Cain, is that which is renewed by the ſame blood of the Mediatour between Chriſt and all the poſterity of Adam, vertually and radically. This is that which Chriſt hath obteined at the fathers hands to be anew entered into with man, for his farther proof and triall. Unto this miniſtry Chriſt is enabled and qualified, either by himſelf or by his meſſengers and ſervants, to bring back againe the whole world unto God, according to that invitation of his, Iſai. 55.1.2. Ho, every one that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mony: come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk, without mony and without price. Wherefore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoule delight itſelf in fatnes. All this yet lies short of the ſaving grace and ſure mercies of the new and everlaſting Covenant, which is propounded by itſelf afterwards, v. 3. So then, thus far the Goſpell is and may be receaved by Cain, and thoſe of whom God ſwears in his wrath, that they shall never enter into his Reſt. Unto theſe the promiſe is made conditionally of entering into Reſt, and they fall short of it through hardnes of heart and unbeleife. The WORD preached unto them does not profit them, as to eternall ſalvation, becauſe they are not united to it by faith, or have not the inſeperable union contracted between the Son of God and them, in the Covenant ordered in all things and ſure, which true ſaving faith workes.</p>
            <p>The word therefore and command of God, conſiſting in a conditionall and in an abſolute Covenant from the beginning, are the ſame two Teſtimonies of the law and Goſpel ſtill, or rather the two Teſtaments that are in force with mankind by the death of the Teſtatour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. By the firſt of theſe, man is renewed and reſtored out of the fall, and brought in ſome degree to the fruition and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his firſt righteouſnes and freedome of will, in order to the making proof and triall of him once more. And by the ſecond of them, he is regenerated and begotten
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93838:26"/> of the immortall ſeed, into an immutability in righteouſnes and glory, in a life that is from the dead, uncapable ever to be loſt or faile more.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Teſtimonies and Teſtaments of God, are viſible words, inward, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall words and lively oracles, that create their owne ſuitable organs and veſſells in the minds of men, for their reception. And there is an inward ſight of them to be had by man as well as an outward hearing, to which purpoſe it is ſayd, 1 Joh. 1.1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life: that declare we unto you. That which John ſaw, heard and handled, was from the beginning, and was ſeen, heard and handled from the foundation of the world, at ſundry times and in divers manners, under former diſpenſations, till at laſt the dark shadows of him vanished, and the true light itſelf began to shine and dawne in his owne perſonal appearance, firſt in the flesh, and then afterwards in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>There are therefore inward and ſpirituall ſenſes, whereby the man of God ſees, heares, taſts, ſavours and handles the word of God. Such ſenſes there muſt be, becauſe there is an inward as well as an outward man of the heart, which muſt not want his due powers and faculties, any more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For ſince the words themſelvs are divine, even words of ſpirit and life, how can they be otherwiſe perceaved then by ſenſes ſuited to their nature, ſpirituall ſenſes, diſtinguished from thoſe of the animalish, outward man of the ſoule, which is not at all skilled in that manner of knowing and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>From the exerciſe of ſpirituall life and the ſenſes thereof, proceeds the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall taſt, ſavour and approbation of thoſe divine words, that are the ſignifications of Gods will and law to us. Unto ſuch experienced men, skilled in the words of truth, we may appeale, as to the true and full ſignificancy of divine oracles (which the diſputer of this world in the perverſe and preſumptuous uſe of his naturall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and underſtanding, contradicts and blaſphemes) doe you not ſee this truth? doe you not handle with your hands this Word of life? do you not taſt that the Lord is gracious? This is the much more excellent way of underſtanding the Scriptures, when after ſuch a ſpirituall manner we relish, handle, ſe, taſt and have a share in what we know of the word of God, as the Apoſtle prayes, Phil. 1.9. For this I pray (ſayes he) that your love may abound in knowledge and in all judgment, or in every ſpirituall ſenſe.</p>
            <p>He that was from the beginning is Chriſt, the living WORD of God, the WORD wherein was life, and that life the light of men, even of every man that comes into the world. He is the light of men, in and under a threefold diſpenſation or manner of miniſtry. He is the word of God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93838:27"/> God to men, that makes with them either a conditionall and diſſoluble Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or an abſolute and everlaſting Covenant that can never be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is the word of the beginning, by which God begins to make himſelf knowne and declare his will in his law to all men, that law, by which they muſt one day be judged.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the word of the oath, conteining a free promiſe to ſome, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious receaving of them into his love, therein to abide for ever; but a finall and judiciall rejection of others, concerning whom he therein ſwears, that they shall never enter into his Reſt, but be given up to the wayes that they have choſen, and fixed in their owne deluſions, in the everlaſting chains whereof he binds them up and reſervs them with the fallen angels to the judgment of the great day. This is that which is the end and conſummation-work both wayes, to all that have paſſed under the firſt Teſtament or conditionall Covenant.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, conſidered as he is the word of the beginning, the author and miniſter of the conditional Covenant, and of the life and quickning proper thereunto, hath a comming forth in light and life unto men, which is called his firſt appearance, which he diſpenſes in the capacity of the promiſed ſeed, purſuant to the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Gods will unto man in paradiſe, immediatly after his fall. He is therein declared the ſaviour and redeemer of man, he by whom alone is remiſſion of ſins, and all thoſe that beleeve not on him shall perish in their ſins. For as Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wildernes, ſo hath the father provided that the WORD made flesh be lifted up in the ſight of all men and preached to them, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him should not perish but have everlaſting life. And God would have men know, that he ſo loved the world as that he gave his only begotten Son to take and beare away their ſins, and lead them into the way of ſalvation, in ſtead of condemning them upon the fall of our firſt parents, as he might juſtly have done. He then that beleevs in the Son of God, is not or shall not be condemned. But he that beleeveth not, that is, receavs not his word in the love thereof, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not beleeved in the name of the only begotten Son of God. The juſtice of ſuch condemnation will shew itſelf in this, that when this light is come into the world, men have choſen and loved darknes better then light: yea, to diſcover the evill of their mind, they hate the light and (as neer as they can) shun all appearance of it, leaſt they should be reproved thereby and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their evill deeds, and be converted, and God should heale them.</p>
            <p>But how is Chriſt (the ſaviour and redeemer) lifted up before the eyes of all men? and how comes he with light into the world, or into the mind of the naturall man, who receavs not the things of the ſpirit of God, but accounts them foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? Yea he cannot know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, and are therefore too deep for him to fathom, too high and heavenly for him to reach, being deſtitute of ſpirituall ſenſes and diſcerning ſuitable thereunto.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93838:27"/>
            <p>By way of anſwer to this, we muſt be carefull rightly to diſtinguish and divide the word of truth, which (as hath bin ſaid) hath a firſt voyce and the light of its firſt appearance, as alſo a ſecond voice and the brightnes of a ſecond comming. It is by means of the firſt voice, and the light and life miniſtred in and by the firſt Teſtament and conditionall Covenant, that the ſpirit of the naturall man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, quickned and wrought upon, which is the very ſame that at firſt gave him his make and primitive being in Gods image; and now by renewing it ſelf and comming with healing and reſtoration in its wings, mans flesh is made fresher then a childs, and he returns to the dayes of his youth, that is, his firſt dayes of primitive purity. This the naturall man receaves as the gift and effect of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is his Redeemer and Saviour, who is ſo gracious as to ſay, and that effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; deliver him from going downe to the pit, I have found a ranſome; Job 33.24.25. But all this quickning and enlightning is but conditionall and may be loſt againe, though abundantly ſufficient to make a full and compleat triall of him that receavs it, in order to his finall ſalvation or damnation.</p>
            <p>But for a ſecond and fuller anſwer, we are to know, that this word of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and voyce of Chriſts firſt appearance, may and does come forth in a threefold light and workmanship upon the heart and ſpirit of the naturall man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that which is a lampe and light in the mind, a worke of the law, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods commandement, conteined in his conditionall Covenant, wrought in the heart, and manifeſting itſelf to the inward ſenſes of the naturall mind by the miniſtry of angels, with which Chriſt does enlighten more or leſſe every one that comes into the world, and in a more particular manner thoſe that are without law or the knowledg of the Scriptures and written word of God. This means of knowledge being by the providence of God with held from them, ſo as that they are ignorant of what it ſpeaks to other men that live under the ſound thereof, he is pleaſed to winke at and paſſe by the day of this ignorance, neither will he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with them in judgment, according to the things they know not, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the things they know, and have the taſt and experience of within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs. And theſe are the inviſible things of God, even his eternall power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the WORD by which all things were created, and whoſe off-ſpring and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we are, according to what we may feel in the inward man of our heart, which was his workmanship, created by him with a ſtrong bent and living conformity unto righteouſnes and true holines. To this ſort of men the WORD hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward voyce and way of teaching, which ſpeaks in them and makes them a rule unto themſelvs in their hearing and obeying this inward operation of the word. Their inward ſight and hearing is truly and properly obeying, which afterwards is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in outward action and practice. Such hearers and doers of the law of God, fulfilling the condition, shalbe juſtified, and God will make good that word of his Covenant to them, if thou doeſt well, thou shalt be accepted and rewarded.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93838:28"/> Concerning theſe (though as to the outward man they be as yet in uncircumciſion, yet keeping the righteouſnes of the law, according to what they know) it is ſaid, that their uncircumciſion shalbe counted for circumciſion, and the want of what they are ignorant of, not imputed to them; Rom. 2. Theſe who by nature (renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Redeemer, though yet unknowne to them, according to the witneſſe given of him in the written word) approve themſelvs faithfull to their light, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing all good conſcience, to the fulfilling of the law, shall condemne them who by the letter and forme of knowledg in the law, are found transgreſſours of it, when tried and judged by the rule they profeſſe to live under.</p>
            <p>The cheif thing that by way of caution and warning is to be ſayd to this firſt ſort of righteous men, is this; that they take heed to themſelvs in this their ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtanding, ſo as to continue under the hearing and teaching of this voyce of the Lord, in that ſoft, pliable and tender frame of heart, in that humble, meek and yeilding temper of ſpirit, that does become the veſſell of clay in the hand of the potter, and the creature under the inſtructing word of the creatour, the turning away and ſettled departure from which, is eternall death. For the Lord leaves it to the power, will and choice of the naturall man, when he comes to be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and enlightned by Chriſt, whether he will hearken to what he has yet farther to ſay unto him or not, according to thoſe frequent expreſſions in the Scripture, if ye be willing and obedient; if ye refuſe and rebell; and againe, whether they will hear, or whether they will fobear. So likewiſe John. 7.17. If any man do his will, he shall know the doctrine whether it be of God; or, he shall know more and more, till at laſt he attein that knowledg wherein eternall life conſiſts; according to that of our ſaviour, John. 12. yet a little while is the light with you, (the light of his then perſonall appearance in the flesh) walk while ye have the light, leſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes come upon you, and you be as he that knows not whither he goes. While ye have the light, beleeve in the light, that is, be faithfull to it, hear and obey it in the preſent voyce and teaching you are under, and it will never leave leading you forward, till it hath brought you to him, or to that laſt and higheſt manifeſtation of the truth, whereby ye shalbe made children of the light, or of the day, even of that wiſedome which is from above.</p>
            <p>This ſort of obedience is that of mans reſtored freewill by light from the inward word, which is good and pleaſing unto God, till man be taught the way of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obeying him more perfectly, and after a more excellent manner, in the way everlaſting. The diſobedience alſo of man in this ſtate, is a free and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act, whereby he hardens his heart againſt the voice and calling of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the holy Ghoſt in the worke of life and immortality, which his office is to ſet up in every truly regenerate ſoule. It is the whole duty of the naturall man to fear God and keep his commandements, who will bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93838:28"/> with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evill. Unto this all promiſes and threatnings of God, all temporall and Spirituall bleſſings do tend, even to render man obedient to his God, in hearing his voyce, walking in his wayes, and keeping his commandements. This in effect is the maine ſcope both of the law and of the goſpell. And whatever we doe in way of obedience, that falls short of walking unmoveably and univerſally in all the commandements of God, with our whole heart, how good or pleaſing ſoever it may ſeeme to us, it is not acceptable nor pleaſing unto God. Let no man therefore deceave his owne Soule or diſſemble with God, (who ſearcheth and knoweth the hearts and the reins) nor let any pretend inability or infirmity, ſince he is neer to every one of us, upon whoſe name if we call, he will ſave us from our ſins and make our reconciliation once more with God, if the fault be not in ourſelvs: Yea, he will ſave us to the uttermoſt, if we continue in our obedience, and in a pliablenes of ſpirit to the voyce and words of his mouth, that will be a ſure guide to us, till it have brought us into that kingdome of his, that cannot be shaken.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the firſt ſort of ſervants and ſubjects that may be found faithfull and obedient unto the word and command of God, which was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Theſe are they that feare God and work righteouſnes, by an inward tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ſuited to the ſpirituall ſenſes of the naturall mind, which is the ſame with the light and law of pure nature. Now of theſe, ſome, and thoſe the greateſt part by far, (being wholly left to their owne choice and in the hand of their owne counſell) continue not in their obedience, but perish through a hardnes and impenitency of heart, in which they rebell againſt the encreaſing meaſure of light with which the holy Ghoſt would enlighten them, in order to the enlarging of their hearts to an entire and ſtedfaſt walking with God in that Covenant of his that cannot be diſſolved. But others of them, through Gods free and peculiar preventing grace, are withheld from ſo ſinning againſt God, and are layd hold on and apprehended by the ſon's comming into their ſoules and contracting a moſt intimate and inſeperable marriage union with them, faſtning them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the rock af ages and cheif corner ſtone, by whom their bow is made to abide in ſtrength, and their arms are made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. Thus of ſervants, they do with the eunuch and centurion (who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Philips and Peters miniſtry of the outward word) become Sons, that are heirs according to the promiſe, or elſe, they are admitted immediatly to the fight of Chriſt in ſpirit, as Paul was in his converſion, unto which heavenly viſion they prove not diſobedient, being taught not only to live in the Spirit, but to walke after the Spirit. This then that we have bin ſpeaking of, is the firſt light and workmanship that Chriſt in his firſt appearance may and does viſit the ſons and daughters of men with, even thoſe that are not yet brought to the knowledg of his voice, in and by the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:93838:29"/>
            <p>There is then a ſecond degree of light and glory, wherein Chriſt breakes forth in the workmanship of his Spirit upon the hearts and minds of men, which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the firſt, is a more excellent and neer approach to the ſight of the Son himſelf, teſtifying moſt particularly in what manner and at what time the WORD was to be made flesh, and in that flesh to be crucified and die for our ſins, and to riſe againe into a life wherein he was never to die more.</p>
            <p>Now the voice of this word is from divine inſpiration, moving in the hearts and ſpeaking by the mouth of Moſes and other the Servants, the Prophets of the Lord, in the old Teſtament, to John the Baptiſt; and afterwards, by the holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, conteining the doctrine of both Covenants, that of works and that of faith, the law and the Goſpell; Theſe divine words and oracles were committed to writing and preſerved for the uſe of the Church, from Moſes his time downwards to this preſent day, by Gods eſpeciall and admirable providence, called the holy Scriptures, which are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. They are not of any private interpretation, but attended with the miniſtry of the holy Ghoſt, in his various diſtributions and gifts, dividing unto every one ſeverally, as himſelf pleaſes, to the making the doctrine flowing from this word, pure and converting the ſoule, that alſo which is an enlightning of the eyes, and a washing of the heart with clean water from its old ſins; it is profitable alſo for reproof, correction and inſtruction in righteouſnes, to the making the man of God perfect, throughly furnished unto every good word and work, even ſuch hearers of the word and doers of the work as prove bleſſed in their deed, if the fault be not in themſelvs, in failing to performe the condition of the Covenant, through that faith which excludes boaſting, and failes not.</p>
            <p>This ſecond ſort of hearers and doers of the word, are they that are alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt, by hearing the voice of the living word, in and through the miniſtry of the outward letter of the Scriptures, teſtifying of Chriſt and of the work of redemption given to him by the father to finish, and of his comming, not by water only, but by water and blood, to the paying a ranſome for our ſins, and for the planting of us into a likenes with him, both in his death and reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Under this ſecond diſpenſation (which is the miniſtry of the outward and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, accompanied with the preſence and power of the holy Ghoſt and his gifts) there is a workmanship of Chriſt, formed in and upon the heart, conſiſting of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall degrees and growths up into him who is our head, the good olive tree, that is willing, ready and able to receave us into himſelf, as our ſpirituall root, which bears us and fills us with the oile and fatnes that ſprings up from the ſame into every branch and member of his body, conſidered either as his body is his living flesh, ot as it is his flesh crucified;</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it is the mannah and living bread that is the life of the world or of the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church and enlightned naturall man, that may eat and drinke in his preſence, at this his table, and eat and drinke his flesh and blood to their owne damnation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93838:29"/>2. There be thoſe that feed upon the crucified flesh, the carkaſſe or dead body of Chriſt, out of whoſe weaknes comes ſtrength, and from whoſe crucifying comes that meat which perishes not, but is bread that nourishes to eternall life. Thus it is written, Rom. 14. None of us that live, liveth unto himſelf, and none of us that die, doe or ought to die unto our ſelvs. But whether our faith be weake and low, and our naturall ability to hear and obey, active and ſtrong in us; or whether the work of our faith be ſtrong and powerfull, and our natural activity weak and low, yea brought into the very grave with Chriſt, the life or the death is not to be to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, but to Chriſt. In and with him muſt we live, and in and with him muſt we die. Whether then we live with Chriſt by faith, as it is weak, or whether we die with Chriſt by faith as the work of it in us is powerfull and ſtrong, we should live to the Lord and die to the Lord, that ſo living and dying we may be found amongſt the number of thoſe that are the Lords. For this end, and to enable us to effect this work of faith, whereby we may live and alſo may die to the Lord, and in neither ſin nor ſerve our ſelvs, Chriſt both died and roſe againe, and is become Lord both of the dead and of the living, even in this ſenſe before opened. To this agrees what the ſame Apoſtle teſtifies, 2 Cor. 4:12.13. compared with 1 Cor. 4.8, 13. Here we find the Apoſtle, the father and true elder, as to his growth up into Chriſt, ſtrong in the faith; and the Corinthians, they are the children, babes in Chriſt, weak and low in faith, but high, full and puffed up in their fleshly minds. Let us therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the differing characters he gives of the one and of the other, though both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, ſuch as in their living and in their dying are or may be the Lords. Ye now are full, ſayes Paul, or this is your time of being rich and reigning as kings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us: but I would to God you did indeed reigne, that we alſo might reigne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with you; But it is otherwiſe with us, even a dying time; We are troubled on every ſide, perplexed, perſecuted, caſt downe, alwayes bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord Jeſus, God having ſet forth us that are the Apoſtles (moſt ſtrong and eminent in faith) as it were appointed unto death, and to be made a ſpectacle to the world, to angels and to men. We are fools for Chriſts ſake, but ye are wiſe in Chriſt: we are weak, but ye are ſtrong: Ye are honourable, but we are deſpiſed. So then death workes in us, but life in you: And we having the ſame ſpirit of faith, according as it is written, I have beleeved and therefore have I ſpoken, we alſo beleeve and therefore ſpeak; knowing that he which rayſed up the Lord Jeſus, shall raiſe us up alſo by Jeſus, and shall preſent us with you.</p>
            <p>That then which is wrought in men by Chriſt, through the miniſtry of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward word, by the ſpirit and life of his firſt appearance, is either reſtoration-work ſingle, or reſtoration-work joyned and accompanied with true regeneration and eternall ſalvation. Reſtoration-work ſingle is that which is called the ſpirit of bondage, making but thoſe ſervants that abide not in the houſe for ever, as having never taſted nor partaken of that freedome, wherewith the Son makes thoſe free
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93838:30"/> indeed, that he knits into an indiſſoluble union with himſelf. But reſtoration-work, as it is accompanied with ſalvation, (or the birth of the immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible ſeed of life and righteouſnes) is that which is called the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of power, of love, and of a ſound or ſtedfaſt mind; that principle of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and ſpringing up in us, whereby we put off that which is mutable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and put on that which is immutable and incorruptible, as well in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man of the heart, as in the outward man of the flesh.</p>
            <p>We have already shewed that their obedience is accepted with God, who are faithfull to their light, under the firſt diſpenſation of Gods word ſpeaking in them, to the inward ſenſes of their mind, as was the caſe of the centurion. Such perſons in every nation are owned by God, as thoſe that fear him and work righteouſnes. And this feare is in a ſenſe faith; for they cannot thus come to God and obey him, but they muſt beleeve that he is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him and hearken to his voyce. Nevertheleſſe, this is not the faith that is in the regenerate, flowing from the ſpirit and life of the new creature, and working by love; but it is the faith which all reſtored, enlightned men may have, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to what Adam had before his fall, that knew and obeyed the eternall WORD, as creatour and maker of both worlds, though not as the redeemer and Saviour of men, by the blood of the croſſe, from ſin and the wrath attending it. This ſort of faith is that which flowes from mans exerciſe of his right knowledg and free will, wherein he was created after Gods likenes, and did receave the truth in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but in no fixed, permanent love thereof, becauſe he was left free to change his mind as ſeemed good unto himſelf, being (in caſe of his failer therein) perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſponſible to the penalties and curſe of the law. For to be created with ſuch a righteous mutable principle of activity and free moving power in the mind, was ſimply in itſelf good, and might be lawfully uſed, to anſwer the end for which it was given, which was by way of voluntary resignation to chang and turne out of that wavering, unſtable active power, though at preſent righteous, into that love that should bind up the moving power of mans Spirit, into a ſtedfaſt and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable delight and reſt in righteouſnes, and into a fixed and unshaken enmity and averſnes of mind to ſin and all evill. By this new creation and forming of the ſpirit of man within him, his firſt freedome is taken from him and done away, or it is ſwallowed up into a freedome much better and more excellent, wherein man is made more in Gods image and after his ſimilitude, then at the firſt. For though all things were in a good eſtate with man at firſt, when God made him upright, (that is to ſay, in a due conformity unto the divine will, for the performance of a pure and holy worship and ſervice to God, juſtice and true judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his neighbour, and for the walking in a due ſobriety, temperance and continence, as to himſelf) yet God would have him know, he might be better made through a new creation, which should more then comprehend all the good of his firſt make, and adde alſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93838:30"/> to it an immutability. God did therefore forbid man to truſt to the uncertaine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and fading glory of his firſt eſtate, and timely to look and make out for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But in ſtead of this, man (notwithſtanding Gods prohibition) runs himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground into a very bad and evill condition. Out of this forlorne ſtate, the firſt thing that God propounds to him, in and by the knowledg of the redeemer, is his reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God is willing to draw him to by the miniſtry of Moſes, and turn him to by the miniſtry of Eliah, even the diſobedient to the wiſedome of the juſt, to make a ready people, prepared for the Lord, to meet and receave him as he is given by the father in a better Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, of which there can never be any breach either on Gods or mans part, as there was and wilbe againe of the firſt Covenant, how often ſoever it be repeated and renewed, unleſſe it end in mans being receaved and taken into the ſecond.</p>
            <p>There is then a miniſtry of the firſt Covenant in the hand of the Redeemer, Sprinckled with the blood of his croſſe, which is able to rectify the depravation of things cauſed by ſin, and mans firſt breach with God, conſiſting in a reſtitution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mans primitive purity, and the remiſſion of ſins paſt, and this by a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead workes, and a returning by faith unto the living God.</p>
            <p>Moſes began this miniſtry; John Baptiſt continued or rather renewed it, as the immediate fore-runner unto Chriſts comming in the flesh; and Elias in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power, (or the ſpirit and power of Elias that is yet to come as the latter raine of Chriſts firſt appearance) shall cary on this work of reſtoration to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and immutability, in the hearts of Chriſts ſlaine witneſſes, and be as the fore-runner and bright morning-ſtar that is to usher in the ſun-shine of Chriſts ſecond comming. Then will Chriſt come forth in his owne perſon, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate publickly before the eyes of the whole creation, the marriage of the lamb with his bride.</p>
            <p>This latter Elias is he that muſt deſtroy that painted Jezebel, which puts Naboth to death by the authority of Ahab, Revel: 2:20, 22; the earthly lying ſpirit of the falſe righteouſnes, in the mouth of the falſe Prophets, which by the ſecular power in all ages, puts to death Naboth, the ſpirit of true Propheſy in the mouths of Chriſts faithfull Servants, by falſe witneſſes, to the treading downe and keeping under the true Prophets of God, during the time, times and half a time, foretold by Daniel and the Apoſtle John.</p>
            <p>And as this Elias muſt rectify the worship of God, ſo muſt he ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the man towards his neighbour. He muſt turn the heart of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the children, and of the children to the fathers, putting an end to all differences betweene the ſpirituall fathers and their children, and the ſpirits of the later Prophets shalbe ſubject to the former Prophets. For when this Elias comes, he will untie all knots, anſwer all objections,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93838:31"/> and reſolve all doubts. In a word, he wil bring back againe the whole man unto his God. He will reſtore the naturall man to his right. He will alſo prepare and point out the way unto the heavenly man, for the obteining of his right. He will reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all Edom to the houſe of Iſrael, and the kingdom shalbe the Lords; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiah. v. 21.</p>
            <p>And why should we doubt or deſpair, but ſuch a time there wilbe, when things (which now are, have long bin, and will yet be more turn'd upſide downe, all out of order, all confounded) shalbe reſtored and brought to right againe? Have not all the Beaſts had their reigne, and shall not Chriſt have his? Shall not his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come, and will be done in earth as it is in heaven, unleſſe we pray ſo without faith and hope? Have we not a promiſe that there shalbe times of refreshing from this heavenly preſence and appearance of the Lord? shall not a generall reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things be the effect of ſuch his appearance, in the very dawnings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Were this to be mans work, no doubt would be made of it. O we of little faith! shall we then doubt of it, when God himſelf undertakes it, the mighty God, the Lord the Redeemer, that is yet to come out of Zion, to turn away iniquity from Jacob, in a ſpirit and power that all muſt bow under and fall before? Let us then upon whom the ends of the world are come, lift up our heads in the ſight of the neerneſſe of this redemption, which is haſtning apace upon us, in deſpite of all the oppoſition that is, can, or shalbe made againſt it.</p>
            <p>This then is that which we are to underſtand by the reſtoration-work, which God begets, carries on and perfects by the miniſtry of the outward and written word, as the handmaid and ſervant to the ſons appearance himſelf in ſpirit. It is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man is firſt brought back againe to God and to himſelf, in the exerciſe of his right judgment and freewill. Then is he alſo ledd out of that into the love which he that hath, dwells in God, takes up his reſt in the divine nature, becomming the habitable part of the earth, wherein the divine nature inthrones itſelf and dwells, as in his temple and reſting place. This is the land of Emmanuel, the true Iſraell's land, the land of promiſe in the ſpirit, the city that hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God, Chriſt himſelf being the cheif corner-ſtone thereof. It is therefore the kingdom that cannot be shaken; at the comming on thereof, all that is moveable muſt be taken out of the way, and give place. He that is leaſt in this kingdom, is greater then John Baptiſt, though he were greater then all the other prophets that went before him; the meaning is, in reference to this reſtoration-work, which is the proper effect of John Baptiſts miniſtry, through which Gods Covenant is repeated and renewed with man in the blood of the redeemer, after which a breach between God and man is ſtill in poſſibility and danger to happen, and the ſpirit of man may be broken off from him, with whom it had bin made one, as a member of the ſame body. For by the power of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring, healing miniſtry of the firſt Covenant, taking force by the death of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93838:31"/> Chriſt, the Lord does create or make man againe of one mind, one will and heart with him, according to the law of the firſt creation, which is throughout condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and may be made void through mans default, as appears by what Paul and Barnabas ſpeake to the contradicting and blaſpheming jews; Actor. 13.46. It was neceſſary that the word of God should firſt have bin ſpoken to you: but ſeing ye thruſt it from you, and judg yourſelvs unworthy, or shew yourſelvs not deſirous of eternal life; lo, we turn to the gentiles. Oh, how liable is the heart of man under this conditional Covenant, (though never ſo far advanc'd) to be ſuddenly broken off againe from God, by its hope and truſt in the creature, or in the uncertain riches, that are either within us or without? This the Apoſtle Paul well knew, and therefore charg'd them that are rich in this world, not to truſt in the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of riches, (no, not in the very inward riches of the heart, as enriched with the reſtored mutable principles of righteouſnes) but in the living God, the WORD that is in our heart and in our mouth, in the perſon of Chriſt, the enduring ſubſtance that never failes nor fades away. Chriſt ſays, wo be to the rich, to wit, that truſt and put confidence in any the above-mentioned fading riches, within man or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Againe he ſays, Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, who doe reſigne the activity, life, and way of working righteouſnes and worshipping God in the fading, reſtored mutable principles of the firſt creation, growing weak, feeble and low in all ſuch wayes even of doing well, wherein man hath whereof to boaſt, in order to a growing rich and ſtrong in the Lord, or in the new-creature life, activity and way of worshipping God, and working righteouſnes in ſpirit and truth, in the ſteady and unchangable principles of everlaſting righteouſnes. We cannot ſerve two maſters, God and Mammon. We cannot take that delight and pleaſure in any creature or ſeeming preſent good whatſoever, which is due from us to God in Chriſt only, but it breaks off our ſpirits from the God of life. To delight in and prefer the way of worshipping God and working righteouſnes, in the mutable, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, humane, creaturely principles of our firſt creation, when reſtored, before the performing all in the unchangable, divine, and never fading principles of the new creation, where God comes to work all our works in us and for us, this is a very high provocation of God, the higheſt and moſt deeply deluſive and unperceaved idolatry, in preferring the creature before the creatour, who is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Mans diſobedience and failing then with God, as to the performance of the condition of the firſt Covenant, renewed and brought into force againe by the blood of the redeemer, is that which ſince the fall does cauſe a new breach between God and man, when it is willfull, working that wrath which the Sacrifice of Chriſt cannot appeaſe. And man is not free nor ſafe from the danger of ſuch wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, unexpiable ſinning, and ſo, of that judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adverſaries, whilſt he is under the dominion and juriſdiction of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93838:32"/> the law. And under it he is, ſo long as he is alive to God but upon the condition required in the firſt Covenant, which makes him a debtour to the whole law, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying him with that naturall ability and exerciſe of free-will, unto which when he truſts, (as he is too apt to do) takes up his reſt, and engages in the ſingle ſtrength thereof, to performe what the law requires, then he falls and provokes God to wrath. This will he never be able finally to prevent or avoid, whilſt he cleaves to and takes up his reſt in the life and activity of his owne free-will, for the enabling him to keep Covenant with God, how rich in ſtock ſoever he may at preſent ſeem to be therein. His only way therefore is, to paſſe, or rather ſuffer himſelf to be tranſlated out of theſe his mutable principles, into that love and ſtedfaſtnes of heart in Covenant with God, which is the end of the commandement, and proceeds from a pure heart, good conſcience, and faith unfeigned.</p>
            <p>Now of thoſe that are alive unto God in the awaken'd principles and renewed life of the firſt Covenant, (by repentance from dead works and faith in God the Redeemer and ſaviour of all men, and this by the voice of Chriſt, through the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the outward and written word) there are ſeverall ſorts, the cheif of which only we shall mention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe who are diligent hearers, willing and zealous obeyers of what they learn, receave and drink in from the holy Scriptures, which they are convinced is the mind and will of God, written for their direction and inſtruction in righteouſnes, either by their owne private reading or by the outward miniſtry thereof. Upon this, they make their boaſt of God, and of the chang wrought in their hearts through repentance and faith; of their walking with God in the purity of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and towards their neighbour righteouſly, according to the commandment delivered unto them. Hereby they do indeed come to be quickly and deſervedly diſtinguished from the prophane world, having the forme of knowledg and of the truth in the law and written word, into the mould whereof the whole man is by them endeavour'd to be caſt. But all this is but of little availe to them that ſtay here, and reſt in the letter of the Scriptures which are not he, but teſtify of him that is come himſelf in his owne perſonal appearance, God manifeſted in flesh. And he afterwards died and roſe againe, according to the Scriptures, and revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſpirit, the better comforter and anointing, which teaches all things. All this the voice of the Scriptures points at and ſends thoſe unto, that deſire to be made partakers of the life that is eternall. But thoſe that hear or obey not this voice, do provoke, So that though a promiſe be left unto them of entring into the true reſt, they fall short of it through unbeleif and pleaſing themſelvs with a falſe reſt and ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this firſt degree of reſtoration-work and lively change which is and may be wrought by the miniſtry of the outward word, to the bringing of men into a mutable ſtate of righteouſnes, which they are upon all occaſions
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93838:32"/> in danger of loſing and falling from, how ſure ſoever they eſteem themſelvs to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond ſort of hearers there are, obeyers of the holy commandment deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them, not only by the teſtimony and preaching of the written word, but by the knowledg of the Son himſelf, Chriſt in ſpirit, (which is a degree farther then the firſt goe) who manifeſts himſelf to them in a likenes and glory that is bread, and ſutable food to give life to the world, or to man in his firſt nature. Such practicall knowledge and ſight of Chriſt is able to heal and reſtore man from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy of ſin, cauſing him to eſcape the pollutions of the world and to be washed from his old ſins. Concerning ſuch is it ſaid, that it is impoſſible for them, having bin thus enlightn'd, having taſted the heavenly gift, bin made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, or Chriſt in ſpirit, and taſted the good word of God, and Powers of the world to come (ſo far as the natural man can be heightned and rais'd to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of, on this ſide true Regeneration) if or when they fall away, to renew them againe unto repentance. The reaſon is, becauſe they do eminently crucify the Son of God afresh in themſelvs, and put him to open shame; yea, they trample him under foot, accounting the blood of the Covenant whereby they were ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, an unholy thing, and doe deſpite to the Spirit of grace. Theſe, before their perſonal fall or apoſtaſy, are not properly under the ſpirit of bondage, as meer ſervants, but are rather children of that kingdom out of which they may be caſt, who ſtrivingly may ſeek to enter in at the ſtreight gate after an undue manner, and ſo shall not be able to enter. When once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath shut to the door, and they ſtanding without, knock at the door, deſiring ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and alledging for themſelvs, that they have eaten, and drunk in Chriſts preſence, and that he hath taught in their ſtreets, his anſwer to them wilbe, I know you not whence you are: depart from me all ye workers of iniquity, to the place where shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth. You shall ſe Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob and all my true prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourſelvs (that have in one ſence bin the children of the kingdom) thruſt out; Luk. 13:24, 28. Mat. 7:21, 23. and Math. 8:12.</p>
            <p>Theſe are branches in Chriſt the true vine and good olive tree, partaking of his ſap and fatnes for a ſeaſon. But by reaſon of their mutable principles and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſtanding under the firſt and conditionall Covenant, they come at laſt to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to be cut off from the root and caſt into the fire that never shalbe quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Jo. 15:1, 6. Rom: 11.</p>
            <p>In this laſt ſort, the reſtoration-work is carried up very high, ſo as to place them that have it, amongſt the number of thoſe mention'd, (1 Cor. 13:1, 3.) that may ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels, have the gift of prophecy, underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledg. Yea, though they should have all faith, ſo as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93838:33"/> to remove mountains: though they should beſtow all their goods to feed the poor, and give their bodies to be burned, and yet not have love, or that faith which works by love, they will come at laſt to nothing. They will prove and shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to be in the iſſue, but as ſounding braſſe, and a tinckling cymball. This is that, the higheſt reſtoration-work will diſcover itſelf to be, where it ſprings up but from the ſingle ſeed of that righteouſnes, which is unaccompanied with true regeneration, or that faith which works by love, changing the naturall mind of man from its mutable into an immutable principle of life, righteouſnes and glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly therefore, this work of reſtoration may and does proceed in ſome ſo far, as not only to ſet all right and ſtreight within and without man, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and in an eminent prevailing activity, according to what it was at firſt, when he was made in Gods image, but it hath a ſecond and farther operation upon the ſoule, which prepares and makes ready the will to deny itſelf, take up the croſſe, and become abſolutely reſigned up to the will of another, even of the Lord, as the ſure guardian and keeper of the will in its trueſt and beſt freedom, which ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord is, that is in ſuch a manner performed, that we can do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, but all for it. Through this ſecond operation, the Lord himſelf, who is the immortall ſeed, does moſt powerfully beget us, and that of his owne will as he is the Son of Man, begotten into the love of the father, and made unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſubjection and obedience to his fathers will. He doth cleave unto us, lay hold on us, and put under his everlaſting armes to make our armes ſtrong and to guide us in that way of coworking with him in a joyntnes of will and operation, that nothing can diſſolve. Such fooles for Chriſt ſake, with Paul (1 Cor. 4.10.) through the intire reſignation of themſelvs to the ruling power of Chriſt in their hearts, will not, cannot erre or miscarry in the holy way of Gods ranſomed ones. This is that which the Apoſtle meanes by love, 1 Cor. 13. and chap. 8.1. where he ſayes, knowledg puffeth up: but love edifieth; that is, makes firm and ſtedfaſt work of it. It erects that building founded on the rock, (Math. 7.) that is unmoveable, and cannot be shaken.</p>
            <p>This love of God by which he makes us his choice ones, lies cloſe and concealed a great while in the heart, during which time the work of faith is weak and low, very wavering and apt to faile. But afterwards, by falling into divers temptations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our faith is put to its proof, it does of weak become ſtrong. When faith thus begins to come forth with power, that love by which it workes is ſpread abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is given to us, whereby we come to experience our ſelvs to be firmly rooted and grounded in the love of God, to the making us able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the length, breadth, depth and height of it, whilſt the communication of it is enjoyed by any meaſures. Some do aſcend yet farther, even to know the love of Chriſt in its higheſt and moſt extenſive diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of itſelf, paſſing knowledge, exceeding all meaſure, and filling them with all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93838:33"/> the fulnes of God. The former communication of God who is love, is the ſingle portion or gift of Chriſt in ſpirit, which all true Saints have their share in. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the double portion, which they only do inherit, who are made Gods firſt born Sons, higher then the kings of the earth, whoſe names are written in heaven.</p>
            <p>Concerning this love in both theſe ſorts of true beleevers and Saints, we shall come in its proper place to a more particular ſearch and conſideration. Firſt, we shall enquire into it, as it is in its concealed ſtate, making us babes in Chriſt, in a low and weake exerciſe of ſaving faith; 2dly as it hath a time wherein it comes to be ſpread abroad in the heart, to the warming and quickning of it, and to the fulfilling of the work of faith with power, in an activity that failes not, but is immutable, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing more and more to the perfect day of Chriſts ſecond appearance. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, we may ſay, that this is that love which (2 Cor. 3.) is called the ſpirit, which where it is, there is liberty, even a liberty with open face to behold the glory or image of the inviſible God, and by beholding it to be transformed into the ſame image, from glory to glory; a ſtate directly oppoſite to that of the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. The love we ſpeak of, does truly regenerate and bind up the will in a unity of operation with the will of the Son of God. It workes that hearing eare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying heart to Chriſt in ſpirit, in the life and exerciſe whereof true and ſaving faith does conſiſt; yea, it is the activity itſelf, which quickens that faith, and by the which faith workes.</p>
            <p>This love hath its beginning in us, in and with Chriſts firſt appearance; but it is perfected and comſummated by working out the redemption of the body, at the day of the manifeſtation of the Son of God in the brightnes of his ſecond comming. At that time, the creature itſelf, the very animalish and ſenſuall ſoule in us, with the filthy garments of the mortall body wherewith it is clothed, shalbe freed from the bondage of corruption, and brought into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, putting on the chang of raiment which in that day wilbe provided for it.</p>
            <p>With this love the father loved our head, the ſecond Adam. And the WORD that was from the beginning, laid hold on the ſeed of David ſo as that both he that ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth and he that is ſanctified, became one, one engraffed WORD that is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love, the ſpirit wherein he is alwayes well pleaſed, which can do nothing but what he ſees the father do; and thoſe things he does and fulfills after him, with a heart after the fathers heart. He is ſo entirely in the fathers love and well-liking, that he shews him all that himſelf doth, or hath a purpoſe and intention to do. For this end Chriſt hath ſanctified himſelf, that is, our nature in his owne perſon, that he which ſanctifieth and we that are ſanctified may be all of one, of one immortall ſeed, and he not ashamed to call us and owne us for his brethren. As he is, ſo are they that are borne of one and the ſame immortal ſeed, each one reſembling the children of the great King. They become one with him (through this birth) as he is one with the father. They are fixed and rendred unmoveable in his love, as he is in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93838:34"/> his fathers love. This they arrive at, by his declaring to them the fathers name, or giving the manifeſtation of the fathers love, as he and the father are one, that the love wherewith the father hath loved theſe his children, may be in them, and that the Spirit of the Son that lives in the fathers love, may alſo be in them, even the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, father. From thence-forward are they evidently no more ſervants, but true heaven-born Sons and heirs of God through Chriſt, being taught to know God after the ſame manner as they are knowne of him, and to apprehend that for which alſo they are apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>It is Chriſt in the ſpirit of this love, that apprehends the ſoule, layes hold on the heart, and cleaves to it, as he is the ſealed one of the father, till he change it into the ſame love and image, from glory to glory, working us into ſuch a conjunction in ſpirit with him, and likenes in operation to him, that not we, in the exerciſe of our former and naturall free will, but Chriſt in this his love and glorious liberty of the Son of God, lives in us and we in him, as in a Kingdom that cannot be shaken. This love does not only caſt out fear, but frees from all danger of any more breach of Covenant with God, whence his finall departure from us should follow, or our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from him. This way of giving himſelf to us, is love indeed, in a much more excellent way then appeared in ſuch gift as he made of himſelf to us in our firſt creation, or in his reſtoration-work upon us ſince, ſingly conſidered as that whereby he makes a new proof and triall of us.</p>
            <p>In both thoſe two former ſorts of reſtoration-work above mentioned, God is indeed pleaſed to make us his people, manifeſting himſelf and his will to us, and making knowne to us good and evill experimentally, ſo that we have taſted of the evil and of the good, when the Lord hath reſtored our firſt fredom, and put it in our power againe, to cleave to him and love him, or elſe to leave and forſake him. In this ſtate he ſet Adam, under the counſell, rebukes and threatnings declared in his law, with a liberty to ſtand or fall. Whoever then ſtands upon theſe tearms with God, is alwayes in the ſame danger, can never be out of the fear of a breach that may happen between God and him, through his owne default. The comming of that love and the ſpirit of it (above-mentioned) into the ſoule, does perfectly ſecure from and caſt out all ſuch feare, And this it doth perform by its attracting, prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power in and over the will, whereby man is brought to give up the abſolute Rule and power of keeping himſelf, into the will of him that is this love, and is made fully content to be in his hands and under his wormanship, as a little child, created a new unto the good works before ordeined, that we should walk in them. The ſoule is hereby fitted and prepared with a meeknes and lowlines of mind, to draw together in one yoke with the ſpirit of this love, whoſe command is eaſy and burden light, requiring no more nor other thing to be done, then what by faith we ſe our head the ſecond Adam in our very nature, to have done before us. And as many as are taught and enabled by Chriſt, to walk with him according to this rule, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93838:34"/> is as a race ſet before them in his croſs, they are the true Iſrael of God, and mercy and peace shall for ever reſt upon them.</p>
            <p>Conformity to this rule of the croſſe, is the high way, the way of holines, which all the ranſomed of the Lord are appointed to paſſe, and wherein the waifairing men, the true pilgrims on earth, though become as fools and little children, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, but will infallibly come to Zion with ſongs and everlaſting joy upon their heads. But this way of holines appears to flesh and blood ſo ſtrait a gate to enter in at, ſo fiery a baptiſme to paſſe through, ſo bitter a cup to drink up, that none whoever, that are left to the freedom of their owne wills or naturall liberty reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will ever be inclined to drink it off or conforme to Chriſts example and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand therein. They looke upon ir as a rock of offence, a ſtone of ſtumbling, which they know not how to get over, nor have any mind to it. This bitter cup and hard ſaying, is provided by God, as the bitter waters were of old, to try the adultreſſe or falſe hearted wife to her huſband. It hath the like operation both wayes, as the antitype and myſtery of the bitter water in the Moſaical miniſtration. It hurts not thoſe that are chaſt, in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile, but makes them more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good works, ſuch good works as proceed from a lively, operative, ſaving faith, which thoſe that truly and ſavingly beleeve in Chriſt, wilbe carefull to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein. But it corrupts and rotts others, ripening them faſter on to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It is to this ſacrifice of the firſt freedom of our wills, or free wil offring, that the Apoſtle exhorts us, Rom. 12.1, 2. I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies, or living ſoules, a living ſacrifice; holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, your reaſonable ſervice, or the ſervice which your reaſon owes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, in ſeing and accounting yourſelvs fools under his teachings, and weak and inſufficient, under his ruling power in you.</p>
            <p>Obj: But it will be objected; If I ſuffer the freedom of my owne will to be taken from me, I either become a perfect ſlave, or am reduced into that neceſſity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with which all creatures work by a Kind of inſtinct; ſo shall I come to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manned, and made a very beaſt.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. In ſuch ſuggeſtions and groundleſſe ſurmiſes, we erre, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. If we did, both theſe conſequences of mans being reduced to ſlavery or beſtiality, (through ſuch reſignation of his freedom and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers (that make up his reaſonable ſacrifice) into the hands of God, who will returne all back againe with uſury) would appear exceeding far from truth, as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For ſo far is that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a beſtiall ſtate of life and will, that ſucceeds in the room of our rightly reſigned freedom to the will of God, by the croſſe of Chriſt, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with him in his death, that it highly advances man into a more glorious liberty, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liberty of the ſons of God, a freedom to good only, a liberty to do all things for the Truth, atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with a kind of powerfull impotency or impoſſibility of doing any thing againſt the Truth. What other liberty the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is left to the holy and elect a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels, that are by a ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d work of Chriſts ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds made immutably good, all poſſibility

               </gap>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93838:35"/> in them to evill, being removed, and utterly and for ever taken away from them? This likewiſe is all the freedom left to Jeſus the Son of Man, whereby when the evill one comes, he finds nothing in him, becauſe he and the father are one in their willing power, in exact likenes and agreement. God himſelf alſo, the moſt free agent of all, never had the leaſt poſſibility or fredom to evill. He hath not the leaſt ability that way. To work evill, is utterly impoſſible to him.</p>
            <p>True fredom then is a power to will immutably that which is good; to do it, not only without any reſiſtance or hindrance from within him that wills or does it, but againſt all the tempting or attempting power of any other perſon or thing without him, that might induce any chang of mind, if it were poſſible. Thus God is moſt free, who tempts none, nor can himſelf be tempted to or by evill. And thus is he free, who is fully born of God, into a likenes and conformity with his divine fredom of will; nor can he ſin, becauſe he is born of God, and ſo far as the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſeed in him is his keeper, the evill one cannot touch him, or be able to get within him, but at laſt is totally and finally overcome by him.</p>
            <p>This is the love that with a holy and delightfull efficacy, attractivenes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſivenes, carries the regenerate ſoule captive to the obedience of faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it with the greateſt readines and delight, to run the race of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Chriſt is reſponſible for us alſo to his father, that none of us shalbe loſt, but he will rayſe us up at the laſt day, perfected in this love, againſt which there is no law, or penalties by the law, that are in force, becauſe it is the very end for which the law was at firſt delivered unto man. Through the power of this love, the inward man of the heart is bound up as in a bundle of life, in and with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and quickning power of the holy and bleſſed will of Chriſts manhood. And the will of the ſenſual and inferiour part of our ſoule, which is as the door and mouth to the inward man, is ſo conformed, ſubjected and bound up in unity of operation and agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with it, as that where the heart ſo beleevs in Chriſt and loves him, by the mouth belonging to that heart he is anſwerably confeſſed and glorified, and comes at length by both, in exact harmony, to be immutably ſerved and poſſeſſed world without end.</p>
            <p>In this third ſort of beleevers, hearers and doers of the law and will of God, under the teaching and outward miniſtry of the Scriptures, this love is and dwells. Theſe are the truly regenerate, heirs according to promiſe, that are rooted, grounded and made ſtedfaſt with God in his Covenant. Theſe are they that through the transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and prevailing power of Chriſts love, dwelling and working in them, are drawne to that ſight and knowledg of the father, and of the Son, and of the unity and agreement of will that is between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which flesh and blood cannot reveale. They are taught alſo to employ and make uſe of their naturall ability and ſtrength in the reſtored fredom of their will, ſo as to anſwer the end for which that liberty was firſt given, which was, not that they should therein be their owne keepers, but ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93838:35"/> to be kept and ſubjected under the Rule that God would ſend and give unto them for that purpoſe, to lead them in the right way, evidently trod by himſelf, that is, the way of the croſſe and true ſelfdeniall, which does infallibly guide and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably keep the wayfairing man that walks in it, from all poſſibility of erring or falling short of entring into the promiſed land and true Reſt, in which eternall bleſſednes conſiſts. And in this they are inſtructed by the ſacraments of baptiſme and the Lords ſupper. So much by way of anſwer to the third particular enquiry, in order to the clearing up what is ſought after in the 3d generall querie, in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The 4th particular enquiry under the ſame 3d generall head, demands, how man comes in a judiciall manner to be hardned by God, made a veſſel of wrath, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for deſtruction, with an impoſſibility to chang his mind from evill to good, any more then thoſe that are truly ſaved, can change from good to evill? Theſe are in a ſtate that can never be repented of, nor is there need. The other are in a ſad eſtate, even ſuch as admits of no repentance neither, no, though with Eſau they do ſeek it carefully and with tears.</p>
            <p>The anſwer then to this query may be plain and short, from what hath bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewen at large. The ſteps and degrees by which men come into this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, take as followeth. By the good will and patience which is shewed to them by the redeemer, and by them abuſed, do men come to this judiciall hardning and fixednes in evill. Chriſt is content freely to begin anew with all mankind, as he is that word of the beginning unto them, which works their reſtoration more or leſſe, towards their primitive ſtate, as man was created, in Covenant with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any breach hapned. And he does commit their ſoule (ſo reſtored againe) to their owne keeping, and under the ſame law and condition as before, ſave only that now if they be found wilfully to break off and depart from God a ſecond time, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the Son of God a fresh and thereby putting him to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shame, there remains no more ſacrifice for their ſin, no reſtoration out of it, no chang of mind from it or averſnes to it, but a perpetuall condemnation of them (as they juſtly deſerve) to be made bondslaves to ſin and Satan for ever, whoſe counſell and will they have ſo inexcuſably followed and preferred before Gods. And the higher they have bin rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in light and in the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heavenly gifts, by them abuſed through the undue exerciſe of that free will to which they are left, the deeper will they ſink in everlaſting torments and ſorrow, to all eternity, through the ſenſe they shall have of their ſlighting, reſiſting and rejecting, againſt their owne ſoules, the operations of the ſpirit of love, the yeilding whereunto had bin the only way to have made them inheritours of it, as well as others. They fondly preferred their conceited way of being ſaved in the ſingle exerciſe of their owne freewill and choice, before that way which the love and faithfulnes of God had choſen for them and chalked out to them by the rule of the croſſe, in the knowledg of Chriſt, and him crucified,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93838:36"/> evidently ſet before the eyes of their very naturall man, in the Sacramentall ſignes of his death, on which he appoints them to feed, as ſo manifeſting him unto them, till he himſelf come in his owne perſonall appearance in ſpirit, to shew them the ſame myſtery in the ſubſtance it ſelf, or originall patern.</p>
            <p>Of the above-mention'd ſorts of beleevers, partaking of the light and life of Chriſts firſt appearance, from the voice and teſtimony of the ſcriptures, together with the ſacramentall ſignes of his death, inſtituted by commandment from God in his written word, does the viſible Chriſtian church conſiſt, that hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs to the rule of the Scriptures for their guide, and are faithfully obedient in putting into practice what is therein revealed. Amongſt theſe there alwayes is (as we have shewed) a ſelect number of hidden and beloved ones, kept through the power of faith unto ſalvation, without whom the reſt would be as Sodom, and Gomorrah. And for the ſake of this ſmall remnant, (that truly and properly are Gods heritage out of all the reſt, as the new wine in the cluſter) it is, that the Lord ſayes, deſtroy it not, for there is a bleſſing in it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they that being in and under the law of the Scriptures, the teaching of Gods outward and written word, shalbe judged by this law, as to the things they are found failing in, and as to their comming short of the end ſet before them in this miniſtry. Now the end of it is, to bring them by faith to the ſight and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Chriſt himſelf, ſpeaking in ſpirit, as he is the word of the beginning, and gives forth the light of the glory of God in his, owne face, with which he shines in the hearts of his people. This comes to paſſe when once it pleaſes the father to reveal his Son in us, ſetting him as a living patern before the eyes of our faith, that in unity and ſimilitude of ſpirit with that wherein the works are done by him in himſelf, we may fulfill the law of God after him, and be brought to live and dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame love, which hath its ſeaſon of dawning in the heart, as the true day-ſtar, to prepare the ſoule to meet with Chriſt in the glory of his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe is it ſaid, Rom: 8:1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the flesh but after the ſpirit. When they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the ſpirit, they do end there alſo, and draw not back to be perfected in the flesh. As they live in the ſpirit, ſo their care and practice is, to walk in the ſpirit, rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, and having no confidence in the flesh. Their praiſe is of God, not of men. They loſe the prayſe and honour of men, becauſe they ſeek both of them from God only. They are ſtrangers and pilgrims with him on the earth, as all their fathers were. They ſojourne in tents, in the outward land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, the ſtreets of the viſible church, and various ſelf-choſen wayes of viſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which Chriſtians of different judgments walk in. Theſe inviſible ſaints have their eye ſet upon the heavenly countrey and building, that hath foundations, which is the workmanship wrought in God, the engraffed WORD, and by him is held forth to the eye of that faith that is the evidence of things unſeen, and is able to espy for us this land of promiſe in the ſpirit, whilſt it is yet at a great diſtance and very far off. There is evidently ſet before this eye of our faith, the crucified ſpirit of Chriſt, as he offered up himſelf in ſacrifice to the will of the father, learning obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93838:36"/> by the things that he ſuffered, in denying his owne will, that we may tread in the ſame ſteps, dying with him that we may live with him, and ſuffring with him that we may reign with him. Through ſuch fellowship with him in his ſuffrings, and conformity with him in his death, we shall be found ſtill advancing and preſſing forwards, if by any means we may attein the reſurrection of the dead, or that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the body, which is atteinable in this life, by thoſe that diligently preſſe after the mark, for the prize of their high calling which is in Chriſt Jeſus. This reſurrection and redemption of the body will be experimented upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the witneſſes, and then better underſtood.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the eagle-eyed beleever lives upon the dead carkaſſe of Chriſt crucified, ſeen ſo in ſpirit. And he is content as a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his dead body, to be made the ſcorne and off-ſcouring of the world, a member of the forsaken Zion, that dwells in the feild, in a wildernes-ſtate, ſolitary and alone, that no man regards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his dwelling is in the duſt, in expectation of riſing together with Chriſts dead body. Untill that ſeaſon, this ſort of beleevers, in ſtead of being found within the pale of the viſible church, do follow Gods invitation of them into the ſecret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his preſence, and do dwell in his houſe, (a building not made with hands, in the perſon and ſpirit of Chriſt) where they behold his beauty, shutting the doors about them, as to any viſible entercourſe with the worldly Church. Thus they hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelvs, as it were, for the little moment, that his indignation is to laſt and be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the power, and during the reigne of the Beaſt. Bleſſed are thoſe that thus die in the Lord, (though by the world called and accounted phanatick) waiting for the brightnes of his ſecond comming. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p>To shut up the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and cloſe the miniſtry of the day of Chriſts firſt appearance, as after this manner the Redeemer hath bin lifted up in it, and the work of common and temporary as well as of peculiar and eternall Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption hath bin wrought by him and made manifeſt to all ſorts of men and of beleevers in the world, we shall now come, in the next place, to a diſtinct conſideration of the fourth and laſt generall head of enquiry, above mentioned in this diſcourſe, which is, concerning the very being, life and conſtitution of the new creature, or that immutable ſtate in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and glory, that begins in the day of Chriſts firſt appearance, and is perfected by his ſecond.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth generall enquiry then is about the immutable ſtate of life and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes in the new creatures conſtitution, or that change which is brought upon man by the new creation. The new creatures life is founded (as hath bin shewed) in the birth of the fathers love in the ſoule. Of this love are they born, who are by Chriſt the immortall ſeed, layd hold on, cleaved unto, and apprehended in that intimate and inſeperable marriage-union in ſpirit, which is never to be diſſolved; in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things and ſure, that is contracted in his perſon, between the father and the Son, through the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Where ever this union is, there is Gods love; there is Chriſt inſeperably united to that ſoule for good. And although this kind of life and union, do lie hid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93838:37"/> (as it may) for a long time, aſleep in the veſſell of the mind, as Chriſt was in the ship when it was in danger to ſink with the waves, yet by it is the ſoule Kept and ſeperated to the Lord, as Paul was from the womb, notwithſtanding which he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as a Phariſe, nay, as a perſecutour of the true church, till this ſeed of Gods love revealed itſelf in him. This is the firſt degree of the new creatures hidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſtate, and this foundation of God is ſure; for he knows who are ſealed with this his living ſeal from the womb, though neither as yet themſelvs know it, or any other, but only the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>The ſecond degree of new creature life, ariſing from the immortall ſeed of Gods love, ſealed as yet and concealed in the heart of the beleever, is, as it yet lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt and at botome, ſuffring Eſau the elder brother to come out firſt into view. It gives way to the reſtoration-work which puffs up the flesh, in making the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the naturall man full and rich in his firſt abilities of pure nature, and exerciſe of his freewill. Such a ſaint girds himſelf as peter had done, when he went whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he would. He wil be a very active, couragious follower of Chriſt, whilſt he works miracles and all the world runs after him; yea, he will promiſe faire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to goe even to priſon and death with him; but in the hour and power of darknes the faith he acts upon this bottome, and all his other graces faile and abide not the triall, unleſſe the ſeed which lies undermoſt, appear and shew forth its preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, overcomming, and never failing power.</p>
            <p>In this 3d ſtate or degree of new creature life, we are with the Corinthiaus, ſuch as are carnall and babes in Chriſt, but cannot properly be addreſſed unto as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Chriſtians. We are ready in this ſtate, with good Samuel, to ſay of Eliab the elder brother, ſurely the Lords anointed is before us, in the reſtoration-work, wrought by the ſpirit of Chriſt in our ſoules. We are little aware that the true David, the man after goes owne heart, the inward man, which feeds upon that which is not corruptible, lies hid and is not yet ſeen as he is, but under a veyle only and as through the latteſſe. In theſe, true ſaving faith is but weak and low, not knowne rightly to themſelvs, but upon grounds that may and will fail them.</p>
            <p>A third ſtate or degree of this new birth and new creature life, is, when upon being found triall-proof, the love of God comes to ſpread itſelf abroad in the heart by the holy Ghoſt; when the ſeed which is at the bottome and lies under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, works and removes out of the way, him that lets, every impediment and weight that preſſes downe. It comes now to circumciſe the foreskin of the flesh, which is the cover and veile under which it hath layn ſo long hid, bringing under and laying low the fleshly man in us, teaching him ſubjection and shewing him that law, by which the elder is to ſerve the yonger and come behind, but no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to lead the way or be preferred before him. For the naturall man to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this diſcipline, is the great croſſe which is ſo fiery and dreadfull to flesh and blood; the cup, which, if it were poſſible, every one would avoyd. But, 'tis by this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93838:37"/> means, that the naturall man is made ſubject, and becomes a meet veſſell for the uſe of his Lord. And now, when we are thus in weaknes according to the flesh, moſt low, broken, and crucified, then are we ſtrongeſt after the ſpirit; and the work of faith ſpringing up with vigour, is fulfilled in us with power; ſo comes it to be cleerly ſeen to ourſelvs, though yet very much hid, as to others. When it hath once rooted and grounded the inward man in this love, it will diffuſe the good ointment to the very shirts of the garment, and cloath the beleever with change of raiment, that as the ſoule is made all glorious within, the outward man may be glorified alſo, and Chriſt not only admired in the heart, but glorified in and by the mouth of the ſame beleever, which is the fourth degree of new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life.</p>
            <p>This fourth and laſt degree of the perfecting of the love of God in us; is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the day of Chriſts ſecond appearance, called alſo the day of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſons of God, which we shall now in the next place enquire into and apply ourſelvs to ſearch after, according to ſuch diſcovery thereof as God hath bin pleaſed to make knowne. By way of preparation to this enquiry, let us take notice of what we find deſcribed and foretold of it, by the Prophet Hoſea, chap. 6. v. 2, 3. After two dayes he will revive us, that is, in the end of the ſecond day. In the third day he will raiſe us up, and we shall live in his ſight. Life from the dead, and immortality shall be brought to light in us. The day of Chriſts Kingdom in the ſpirit, (conſidered, as the going forth of it is prepared as the morning, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes more and more to a perfect day) diſtinguishes itſelf into two diſtinct ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It comes upon us and to us as the raine, as the former and the latter rain upon the earth. In the former, it is a Kingdom of patience; in the latter, a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of power. The Kingdom of Chriſt in ſpirit, is that ſtone, which whoſoever falls upon, shalbe broken to peices, or they shall ſplit and break themſelvs in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that fal upon it, whilſt it is yet but the Kingdom of his patience, in himſelf or his ſuffering ſervants, who amidſt all their ſufferings in the flesh, do remain in ſpirit true members of the Kingdom of the ſtone, lively ſtones of Chriſts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall building, abiding firme and unmoveable under all trialls of perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But on whomſoever this ſtone or Kingdom of Chriſt shall fall in the day of its power, when it becoms a mountain filling the whole earth, it shall grind them to powder. It will make them as the chaffe of the ſummer threshing floore, which the wind of Gods juſt anger will ſo carry away, that no place wilbe found for them.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the third day (mention'd Hoſ. 6.) ſeems cleerly to be about the time of Chriſts aſcenſion, and day of Pentecoſt, when the former rain of the ſpirit came downe; or ſome few years after, at the final ruin of Jeruſalem and the jewish Kingdom. To know the certain period of the ſecond day and beginning of the third, will much conduce to the better forming of our judgments, as to the ſeaſons of this Kingdom, that are yet to come. We may hereby alſo gain ſome
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93838:38"/> ſight into the two dayes that are paſt, and the diſtinguished parts of time that the holy Ghoſt does intend and ſignify to us by thoſe two former dayes.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond of them, it ſeemes very evident that the day of Abrahams naturall ſeed, continuing a nation and viſible church, owned by God as a peculiar people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, is certainly intended. Yea, in ſome reſpect we may carry up this day of Abrahams naturall ſeed, as high as shem, the bleſſed Son of Noah, in whoſe loyns and under whoſe bleſſing Abrahams ſeed are comprehended; Gen. 9:26.27. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Shem. and Canaan shalbe his ſervant. The true and right iew is here diſtinguished from all the wicked, hardned world. 2dly. Tis ſaid, God shall en large or perſwade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem, or in the ſame ſpirit of faith, and thereby become a fellow citizen with the Saints, and of the houshold of God. But if this be not admitted, the date of the beginning of this day cannot be denied, according to Stevens computation, (Act. 7.8.) to have bin, at leaſt, when God gave to Abraham the Covenant of circumciſion. And ſo Abraham begate Iſaac and circumciſ'd him the eight day. And Iſaac begate Jacob, and Jacob begate the twelve Patriarchs, that were the originall heads of the twelve tribes, the Iſraelits, to whom perteined the adoption, the glory, the Covenants, the ſervice of God and the promiſes, whoſe are the fathers, even from the beginning of the new world after the flood; and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Chriſt came, who is over all. God bleſſed for ever, Amen. By his comming, he gave a revivall to Gods work in the midſt of its dayes, (Hab. 3.) or in the end of the ſecond day; and by his death, ended alſo that whole diſpenſation of the circumciſion, relating to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeed of Abraham and the Moſaicall miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The ſecond day being thus found in its beginning as well as ending, it will not at all be difficult, from the beginning of that, (eſpecially if conſidered as from the time of Noahs beſtowing the bleſſing upon Sem) to fill up the ſpace of time, of which the firſt day conſiſts. And therein shall we find the continuance of another line, wherein God declared himſelf for the propagating and carrying on of the holy ſeed of the church. For after the death of Abel, that was murdered by his brother Cain, Adam knew his wife againe, and she bare a ſon and called his name Seth; for God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him as another ſeed, in ſtead of Abel whom Cain ſlew, Gen. 4:25.</p>
            <p>This holy ſeed from Seth downwards, in way of diſtinction from the reſt of the world, paſſed under the name of the Sons of God, calling themſelvs by the name of the Lord, and continuing ſo to do, as we find, (Gen. 6.) till the flood came and drowned the old, corrupted, apoſtate world. This reduced the holy ſeed to a new root and ſpring, in the perſon of Noah, an heir of the righteouſnes which is by faith. Hereof he gave the proof, in preparing an ark, at Gods command, to the ſaving of his houſe, thereby condemning the world, that ſlighted and rejected that way of being ſaved.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the two dayes, in the end of the ſecond whereof, we have bin revived by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93838:38"/> the comming of Chriſt in the flesh, dying for our ſins, and riſing againe, according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It remains now therefore to ſearch out, if we can, what is the tract of time, meant by the third day, which is the day of the continuation of Abrahams ſeed, as they are Chriſts. And he that ſanctifies and they that are ſanctified are all of one; He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets and they that are begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the one ſeed that are the Sons of Gods abſolute and, unchangable choice and love. They are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, (no not of the Son of man himſelf, as ſtanding in his owne will, or exerciſing his owne humane freedom, ſingle) but of God, or of the Son of man, as he and the father are one, having as it were but one will betweene them. Of this holy and good will they are begotten, being taken out of their owne wills, and made to ſtand and live in the will of the Son of God, as his reſigned hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane will lives intirely in the will of his father. So come they to be one with him as he is one with the father.</p>
            <p>This ſeed are thoſe that are of Abrahams faith, being of the ſame ſpirit and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ſteps of that typicall father, and of Chriſt himſelf, their father in ſpirit and Truth. Theſe are the true heirs according to the promiſe, and are called to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the bleſſing of Abraham, in the actuall receiving of the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith, the adoption of Sons, which makes them like David, a people after Chriſts owne heart. For the forming and bringing of them to this, God ſends forth the ſpirit of his Son, or his Son in ſpirit, into their hearts, by which thy cry Abba, father. Thus Chriſt comes to dwell in them and with them, purifying them in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as he is pure, to a like-mindednes in all things, with himſelf.</p>
            <p>This ſpirituall ſeed who are Chriſts, (as the children of his Kingdom, the day whereof in ſpirit begins with his aſcenſion) are ſaid (Col. 3.) to be riſen with Chriſt in the affection and deſire of their minds, which is ſet upon things above. This renders them dead to things below, the ſeen things which are temporary and perishing, cauſing them by the eye of faith to eſpy out for themſelvs a life, and to find an ability to worke the righteouſnes, that is immutable. However hidden, weak and low this life and ability may be in the motion and activity thereof, for a ſeaſon, 'tis that that will never faile, as to the effecting in them a conformity to Chriſts death, and arming them to ſuffer in the flesh and to continue with Chriſt the ſeaſon appointed for his temptations and ſufferings, in the whole body of his true members and followers, as well as in himſelf. It prepares them to be his true witneſſes in a ſackcloth teſtimony, a ſtate of patience and perſecution from the world, as wel as afterwards to be the witneſſes of his power and great glory, when he shall come to be glorified in his Saincts and admired in all thoſe that do beleeve. During the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeaſon, they are patiently to undergoe all, approving themſelvs firſt to be faithfull witneſſes under this baptiſme of the croſſe, as they deſire to be found afterwards in the number of the two ſorts of his obedient children, that are to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93838:39"/> reigne with him; firſt, ſuch as are choſen out of the world into the common rank of ſons; ſecondly, ſuch as are choſen out of that choice, to be freinds and ſpeciall favourites. They are both of them appointed and prepared by the father, to ſit on thrones with Chriſt, the one at his right hand and the other at his left, when he shall come forth in his power and great glory, as may ſeem in ſome ſort to have bin perceaved by the mother of Zebedees children, in her untimely and over-forward requeſt on their behalf, Mat: 20:20, 22. She ſeemed deſirous to have them in the throne before they had drunk of the cup, and bin made partakers of the great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations wherein they were to abide with Chriſt, and all other beleevers, in them repreſented. This ſuffring ſeaſon is to hold, till the time of the Gentils shalbe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, for the treading downe and trampling under foot by the ſpace of 42. months the holy city and tabernacle of David that hath bin reared up amongſt them by the Apoſtles miniſtry, after it was fallen amongſt the jews; Act: 15. v. 16, 17. When it was fallen amongſt the jews, it came to be ſet up in the midſt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, a nation that for a ſeaſon did very affectionately bring forth the fruits of the goſpel. Thus the reſidue of men, (thoſe that were not regarded till the jewish nation was rejected and broken off from the good olive tree) were brought to ſeek after the Lord, even all the gentiles upon whom my name is called, ſaith the Lord who doth all theſe things.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt act and effect of Chriſts reſurrection, or of that day in the ſpirit, upon the hearts and minds of the children of this his Kingdom, which is preparing them by the trialls allotted to them in the keeping the word of his patience, to ſit with him on his throne, and shine forth in the day of his power, not only as bright morning ſtars, but as the ſun itſelf in its ſtrength, in the Kingdom of their father.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the whole day of Chriſts Kingdom, wherein he will have the word of his patience kept in faith and faithfull witneſſ-bearing, was without all queſtion, from the time of his Aſcenſion, according as it is written, Act. 1.8. Ye shall be witneſſes unto me, both in Jeruſalem and in Samaria, and unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt part of the earth. To like effect ſpake Ananias to Paul, upon his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (Act: 22:14, 15.) The God of our fathers hath choſen thee, that thou shouldſt know his will and ſe that juſt one, and shouldſt hear the voice of his mouth, that thou mayſt be a witneſſe unto all men, of what thou haſt ſeen and heard. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſomething in this converſion of Paul, which is extraordinary, as to his unction and miſſion into the miniſtry and office of Apoſtleship, yet this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Apoſtles converſion hath that in it, as to the eſſentiall parts of it, which is common to all the ſpirituall ſeed of Abraham. For firſt, they are all cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to know the will of God; ſecondly, to know it by the ſight of the juſt one, Chriſt in ſpirit, through faith; thirdly, to heare the voyce and underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the ſpirit of Chriſts mouth, by the eare that is given them to hear what Chriſt in ſpirit ſaith to the churches, or to particular members of his body; fourthly,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93838:39"/> to be witneſſes according to their meaſure and degree of light, in their ſtations and callings, of what they have ſeen and heard.</p>
            <p>In this ſence, the whole ſpirituall ſeed of Abraham are Chriſts witneſſes, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince his aſcenſion, from which time he began to be ſeen by them in ſpirit, and to ſpeak to them from heaven, by his indwelling preſence in their hearts through faith. True beleevers (as hath bin opened) are of two ſorts or degrees. Both of them are free-born ſons and citizens of the ſame heavenly Jeruſalem and holy city. Chriſt calls them his two witneſſes, and declares the ſackcloth teſtimony of his name which they are to bear, during the treading down of them the holy city underfoot, even by the gentiles of the outward court, for the ſpace of 42 months. But although that theſe two witneſſes were in being, and alſo engaged in the work of witneſſing what they had ſeen and heard, according to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, immediatly after the comming down of the holy Ghoſt upon them, at the day of Pentecoſt, not only in Jeruſalem and Samaria, but alſo to the ends of the earth, yet the time of the treading them underfoot by the gentiles of the outward court, did not begin till ſome hundreds of years after, nor by the ſame reaſon could their ſackcloth teſtimony begin, which had relation to that treading downe, and muſt needs therefore be contemporary with it. When once this began, it was to continue but 42 months, or 1260. years, from the very ſame time as that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that was to tread them downe, came to have its beginning as authorized or permitted to make war with them, and bring them under. To the Beaſt which all the world wonder'd after, and fear'd to make war with, was power given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue 42 months, that he might make war with the ſaincts, and overcome them; Rev. 13.7.</p>
            <p>Who or what this beaſt is, was long agoe made knowne to Daniel, and by him foretold and deſcribed, ch: 7:23, 24. It is ſaid to be the fourth beaſt, ſignifying the fourth Kingdom or univerſal oppreſſing power, that should be on the earth, over the ſaints of God, and that should come in proceſſe of time, to ſtand up in a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity from all the other three Kingdoms, or univerſall monarchies that had gone before it. This conſiderable variation did come to paſſe and shew itſelf in a horn of remarque and note by itſelf, that upheld the ſame oppreſſing power and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples againſt the ſaints of the moſt high, (for the treading downe of the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that the other three had don before, but under a new forme or name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which they had never owned.</p>
            <p>On the account of this name or outward profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which the fourth beaſt came to make in the courſe of the little horne, he plucks up by the roots the worship and many prophane cuſtoms that had bin cleaved to, owned and practiſed, during the reigne of meer down-right heatheniſme, all the time of the three former Kingdoms, Babylonish, Perſian, Grecian, as alſo a great part of the Romane, till this fourth Kingdom or univerſal monarchy came to be headed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93838:40"/> with the little horne, under the ſtyle of univerſall Bishop or cheif preiſt, when the Romane empire that had bin heathenish, came to divide and ſinke downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten horns or Kingdoms, all agreeing yet in this, to give up their power to the little horne, in acknowledging the papacy and univerſal Rule over them in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls, by the Bishop of Rome.</p>
            <p>Theſe ten Kings, with their civil power, thus uniting under one head, as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualls, do together with their head conſtitute that courſe and ſtate of the fourth monarchy, under which it is called the little horne. Now when the time of this combination began, is ſomewhat difficult to ſay, exactly, and to a year. But if the beginning of this little horne be once rightly found out and ſtated, it will not be difficult to ſay when it shall end, or when the witneſſes propheſying in ſackcloth shal end, which muſt be at the ſame time. For the 42 months of this little hornes continuance in its perſecuting power and war on the ſaincts (who propheſy all the ſame time in ſackcloth, as a deſpiſed, rejected remnant of outcaſts) are according to the true meaning of the holy Ghoſt, to take their date and beginning from that conſpiracy or combination of the ten hornes, uniting in one preiſtly head, as to ſpiritualls.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Riſe then of this little horne, we may ſafely aſſert,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there was a time certaine, when the papal power did begin, and that time was after the diſſolution of the Roman empire, as it was meerly heatheniſh. And this power was as the corner ſtone, to cement and build up the ruins of the Roman empire into ten Kingdoms, bearing the name of Chriſtian, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ſupremacy of the pope.</p>
            <p>Secondly. That ſo ſoon as this power was firſt in being, the power which hath made war with the ſaincts ever ſince, did begin. For theſe ten Kingdoms, with their Ghoſtly father the Pope, have ever ſince bin treading down and keeping under the holy city, or true citizens of the heavenly Jeruſalem, neceſſitating the two witneſſes, if they will propheſy at all, to do it in ſackcloth, that is, under great perſecution and tribulation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is evident, that from the time of ſuch beginning of the power of Daniels little horne, or laſt branch of the fourth Kingdom upon the earth, the ſackcloth Teſtimony of the witneſſes did alſo begin. And after the continuance of the one and the other for the ſpace of 42 months or 1260 years, the day of the Kingdom of Chriſts patience is to expire, and the time of the witneſſes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying in ſackcloth is to be no longer. But in ſtead hereof, the time of the lambs wrath is to come and be revealed from heaven againſt all this beſtiall domination over his ſaints, and he will openly take to himſelf his great power, and reigne. He will ſet up his Kingdom over the heads, or on the top of all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Rule with his ſaints or the earth, one thouſand yeaves; Rev. 20. In order and by way of preparation to this, Chriſt comes in the latter rain of his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93838:40"/> ſpirit upon the earth, to gather the harveſt of the world, and keep the laſt and great feaſt of Tabernacles, to which the true ſpirituall Iſraelits amongſt jews and Gentiles are invited, Zech: 14:16, 21.</p>
            <p>Theſe then are the two diſtinct commings of Chriſt, wherein he comes to his people, as the former and the latter raine, in this third day, that is the day of his Kingdom in ſpirit; the day, wherein firſt he shews his royall patience and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance towards his worſt enemies, and the day wherein ſecondly he shews forth his royall power and univerſall, irreſiſtible command in earth as well as in heaven. The one as well as the other of theſe dayes, (or parts of the third day above mentioned) do belong to this great Kings making himſelf knowne, even as he is the Son of man, ordeined by God to judg the world in righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>But it may be demanded, ſince both theſe make but the one day of Chriſts Kingdom in ſpirit, called in Hoſea, the third day, wherein he hath promiſed to raiſe up the children of this his Kingdom, and cauſe them to live in his ſight; how comes it to paſſe, that during the long time of Chriſts firſt appearance, in the Kingdom of his patience, the true ſaincts are in an outwardly ſuppreſſed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition, as inhabitants of the duſt, trampled under foot by the powers of the world?</p>
            <p>The anſwer is eaſy, by this short and cleer diſtinction. The raiſing up or reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of them to live in his ſight, which Chriſt promiſes, is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such a rayſing up, as is wrought inwardly in their minds, directing them to the ſight of things above, and faſtning their affections and deſires accordingly, binding them up in the life which is hid with Chriſt in God. This firſt kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is knowne and experienced in themſelvs, by the renewings of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man day by day, under the perishings and decayes of their outward, when they are looked upon as in the grave, in a very ſad and low condition, by the eye of the world;</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly there is a raiſing them up to live in Chriſts ſight, diſcernably to the very eye of the world. At that ſeaſon, glory and honour shalbe put upon their very outward man, and they shalbe called to ſit downe at Chriſts right and left hand, in the Kingdom of his power, to the viſible treading all their enemies under their feet, like mire in the ſtreets. They shall alſo adminiſter healing and refreshing to the whole creation of God. For in this ſeed, all nations of the earth shalbe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the very creature freed from the bondage of corruption.</p>
            <p>The promiſe then of raiſing up the true children of the Kingdom, shalbe made good both theſe wayes, and that ſucceſſively, the one after the other, as will appear in its proper place, when the day of Chriſts ſecond appearance in ſpirit, shalbe particularly ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to. But in this, the ſcripture is very poſitive, and expreſſe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93838:41"/> that untill we be children of the reſurrection in the firſt of theſe reſpects, during the ſeaſon of ſuffering with Chriſt, we shall never be children of it in the ſecond. If we die not or ſuffer with him now, we shall not live and reign with him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore highly concerns us, even as much as to make our calling and election ſure, to have the certain and cleer diſcovery, yea and practicall experience of what it is that makes the children of the reſurrection in the firſt ſence. For over thoſe only that are ſuch, the ſecond death will have no power. And they alſo are of two ſorts, being found in a firſt or ſecond degree of life from the dead, which is wrought out in Chriſt, as he is the Son of man. In the firſt of theſe, they are made sharers with the holy angels, in their atteinment and fruition of God, and goe no higher. But in the ſecond, they are sharers with Chriſt in that higher atteinment and fruition of God which he hath as he is the engraffed WORD, and is admitted acceſſe to the very ſimilitude and shape of God in his owne proper forme.</p>
            <p>Man by his owne voluntary ſinfull act, hath concluded himſelf, and God by his judiciall act hath concluded all men under the death of ſin and unbeleif. In theſe chains might man juſtly have bin left by God for ever, bound up in an alienation of mind from all good. But by the tender mercies of God in the redeemer, he is viſited by the power of that voice of the ſon of God, which raiſes him out of the grave, awakens him out of this deadly ſleep into which he is not at firſt ſo deeply plunged, as to be irrecoverable and without remedy. This death is properly of the mind, as become the ſervant of ſin; and it is not only that, by which the ſpirit of the mind is gone out from its ſubjection to the law of God, and hath given up itſelf to the rule of the declared enemy of God, the ſpirit of darknes that rules in the children of diſobedience; but it is alſo that, by which the outward man of the heart, (called, Coll. 3. the members of the mind, that are upon the earth) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws itſelf from its due ſubjection and conformity to the dictates of right reaſon (that are ſuggeſted to it from time to time, by the enlightned ſpirit of the mind) and gives up itſelf to vile, ſenſuall luſts and affections, that carry the whole man captive to ſin and death, to commit all iniquity with greedines, and run into all manner of unrighteouſnes.</p>
            <p>The mind which in both theſe reſpects is dead, is a downright ſervant of ſin, and is free from righteouſnes, or hath freed itſelf intirely from under its command and Rule, as it is written; know ye not, that to whom ye yeild yourſelvs Servants to obey, his Servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto righteouſnes?</p>
            <p>The freedom wherein man was at firſt created, was ſuch as whereby he might freely and voluntarily fix himſelf, or rather be fixed in the ſervice of righteouſnes through beleeving, or in the ſervice of ſin by unbeleif. By the one he might have bin for ever free from all danger or poſſibility of ſerving ſin, or turning from the ſervice of righteouſnes. By the other he might in ſuch manner free and diſcharg himſelf from the ſervice of righteouſnes, as never to be receaved into it againe, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93838:41"/> be for ever condemned to the unchangeable ſervitude of ſin, as his punishment.</p>
            <p>The firſt uſe man made of this primitive freedom, was to free and turn himſelf out of the ſervice of righteouſnes, and yeild up himſelf in ſubjection to ſin. And the work of Chriſt the redeemer is to turn him back againe from the ſervice of ſin and power of Satan unto God, ſetting him in as good a condition as at firſt: yea far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to free him for ever from any poſſibility of becoming a ſervant to ſin any more, if the fault be not in himſelf. This reſtoring, renewing and regenerating of man, by the power and workmanship of the redeemer, in whom we are anew crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto good works, is frequently tearmed in ſcripture, a reſurrection, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the dead. But now, this renewing work, flowing from the ſpirit of Chriſt into fallen man, admits of ſeverall meaſures and degrees, which are accompanied with anſwerable operations and effects upon the mind;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It turns man back againe from ſin to righteouſnes, conferring upon him the uſe and exerciſe of his free will in Gods ſervice, upon the like tearms of mutability, as he had it at the firſt creation thereof. And to be thus anew created in and by Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works, is (in a degree and meaſure) to be quickned with Chriſt, and raiſed by him from the death of ſin, as ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law. They that are under this worke and chang, wrought by Chriſt upon their hearts, are yet but under the law, or under the rule and command given by God in the firſt Covenant. This miniſtry of the ſpirit of Chriſt, doth in Scripture paſſe under the name of Moſes, John Baptiſt and Eliah, as the voice of the meſſenger going before, but not the voice of the Son of God himſelf, in his owne perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Therefore, there is a farther and an additionall work to this, (which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes this chang firſt to be wrought) the operation whereof, is to make this a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance never to be repented of, this chang unchangable, by bringing the mind into that better ſtate of fredom, which is for ever excluſive of ſin, or of any poſſibility to chang and return to the ſervice of ſin againe. This ſecond work enlarges the firſt, making it more entire within itſelf then ever it was, in yeilding ſubjection to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, as transform'd into the whole will of God, with an impoſſibility to chang, or turn in affection from it. This is properly the workmanship of the Son himſelf, called Regeneration, which carries in it the fredom with which the Son makes all thoſe free indeed, whom he cauſes to receave him in this gift of himſelf to them, likening them unto himſelf in that lowly, meek, and ſubjected frame of ſpirit, wherein as the Son of man he is prepared to ſe God, and to do alwayes that which is welpleaſing in his ſight.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are under this ſecond work, are properly beleevers, having faith of the right kind, ſaving faith. And they are therein created by Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, with another manner of will and ſpirit then thoſe are of, that are but reſtored only unto the ſervice of righteouſnes, and chuſe there to be left, to work out their owne ſalvation in the ſingle principles of their rectified nature and free will. For in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93838:42"/> them, that freewil offering (Rom. 12.1.) is made, the life of that flesh is offered up in ſacrifice, which the law of faith commands, as the only way to exclude boas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or a being puffed up in the ſervice of righteouſnes; and indeed, to exclude all poſſibility of finall relapſe from God, or returne to the ſervice of ſin.</p>
            <p>This flesh that would live in us, is the power we have to luſt and deſire, move and act of ourſelvs, in the uſe and exerciſe of our primitive free will, either to good or evill, as likes us beſt. This freedom may either be taken away from us by force, or we may be brought through a principle of love begotten in us, of our owne choice to reſigne it up, into the hands of another, ordeined of God thereunto, to keep and manage for us. This is that, Chriſt tells us; (John 6:37, 40.) All that the father giveth me, shall come to me; and it is his will, that of all that he hath given me, I should loſe none, but raiſe them up againe at the laſt day. For I came downe from heaven, not to do my owne will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is his will, that he that ſeeth the Son (as he lives, not in his owne will, but in the will of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and beleeveth on him, (living in the will of the Son, and not in his owne will) should have everlaſting life, and be raiſed up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>To be taken off then by this gift and drawing of the father, from all deſire to live in our owne will, or be at our owne arbitrary, ſingle choiſe and diſpoſe; and to be made willing and contented to live in the will of Chriſt, to be built up in a conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, a unity and ſimplicity in the motion of our will with his, will enable us truly to ſay with the Apoſtle, that now, not we live, but Chriſt liveth in us; and the life that we now live in the flesh, or as yet in the mortal body, we live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us and gave himſelf up to death for us, that he might bring us thus to live in and with him. The life that we thus live, is through his enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening and inspiring motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who for this very e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gives himſelfe to us in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and uncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gable unio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as makes him our very life, or the activity and ſtrength through which we act and live. Chriſts thus being given to us and receaved by us, amounts unto true regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and our being made willing to give up ourſelvs thus unto him is the preſenting our bodies, or luſting fleshly mind, a living ſacrifice, that is holy and acceptable to God. This is to make our living ſoule an offering or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice to God, even the freewill offering of thoſe reaſonable firſt created powers of diſcerning and deſiring, (which however refined, do remaine yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, till the tranſforming work of true regeneration hath paſſed upon them) and this with Abel's, is reputed by God (and therefore certainly in itſelf is) a much more excellent ſacrifice then that which Cain offered, or indeed can be offered by any that retaine the life of their owne will, as the principle of all their motion and activity in Gods ſervice, be it otherwiſe never ſo conform to the letter of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
            <p>They that are under this ſecond work and chang, have the Son of God in them, ſo as to be himſelf the keeper of their ſoules, by oath never to part with or give up his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93838:42"/> intereſt in and Rule over them, unto any but the father. After this manner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave, have and poſſeſſe the Son, is to beleeve and have life eternall, by the new and everlaſting Covenant. And not thus to receave the ſon, is the unbeleif, which when once it takes root, ſprings up with that bitternes and enmity againſt the principle, operation and Teſtimony of ſaving faith in true beleevers, (and ſo againſt Chriſt himſelf, who rules in their hearts by faith) as amounts in concluſion to the very ſecond death. For it carries them on, in to that irrecoverable impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and hardnes of heart, for which God ſwears, they shall never enter into his Reſt.</p>
            <p>To be quickned and riſen with Chriſt in this ſecond work and chang, wrought in the ſoule by him, is that reſurrection into life which never is to ſe corruption or change more. And he that is thus borne of God, doth not commit ſin, that is, the ſin of unbeleif above mention'd, becauſe his ſeed remaineth in him, which keepeth him from ſo ſinning, and the evil one toucheth him not. This heavenly, immortall ſeed and birth of the life that is incorruptible, keeps the beleever in all trialls and temptations, fixed like a rock, and as mount Sion that cannot be moved from holding faſt the confidence of a lively hope, to the end. Yet where this reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and immortall life is in the ſeed, it does not ſuddenly appear or shew itſelf in its owne likenes, according to the mightines of the power that works in us. But however, it is the power of faith, through which we are kept unto ſalvation. It is that, which (after we have paſſed over the day of temptation, the ſuffering ſeaſon) will be ſure to come forth in its powerfull operation, and make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſtablish, ſtrengthen and ſettle us. Hence is it that Chriſt ſayes, if we have faith, (that is, of the right kind) but as a grain of muſtard ſeed, we shall find it to be of ſuch a growing, encreaſing nature, that though it be not preſently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, yet by it shall we be at laſt enabled to remove mountains, and nothing shalbe impoſſible unto it. This is Chriſts meaning alſo, when he ſayes, that he will raiſe up ſuch beleevers at the laſt day, that is, in the day appointed for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of theſe Sons of God, in which they shall appear as indeed they are, to every eye. And the eye that ſees them shall acknowledg them: the eare that heares them, shall bear witnes unto them, that they are the ſeed that God hath bleſſed, not only by ſtrengthning them with might in the inner man, and rooting them in love, but viſibly raiſing them up in his power, to the rendring of them mighty in word and deed. With this kind of reſurrection, that shalbe viſible in the eyes of enemies and all beholders, it is, that Chriſt will raiſe up the ſons of God (before deſcribed) and cauſe them to live in his ſight, in this third day, at the breaking forth of the brightnes of his ſecond perſonall appearance, as the Kingdom of his power, with which (as with the latter rain) he will viſit and refresh the habitable part of his earth, and at ſame time, burne like an oven, in flames of fire, to the conſuming and deſtroying of all his adverſaries.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:93838:43"/>
            <p>The way that God will take to make his ſons manifeſt in this day, is by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work of redemption that shalbe wrought and paſſe upon the outward as wel as inward man of the heart; upon the ſpeaking, acting powers, as well as upon the underſtanding and intuitive faculties of the mind, to the freeing of them both from the bondage of corruption, and ſtating the whole perſon of the beleever in the glorious freedom of righteouſnes and true holines.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This shalbe effected, firſt, by the miniſtry of the holy Angels, as the Elias that is to come, who like the foure winds of heaven, shall breath with their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing gales of propheſy upon the ſpirits of all men, but eſpecially upon belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to the gathering them up into a life of ſpirit, and cauſing them to be (as it were) abſent from the body, in order to be preſent with the Lord, whilſt yet in the body;</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, This work shalbe carried on by the revelation of the ſon himſelf from heaven, for the changing of our vile bodies into the likenes of his moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body.</p>
            <p>We find (Mark. 1.1, &amp;c.) that John Baptiſts miniſtry, though but the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſent before Chriſts face, to prepare his way in preaching the baptiſme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the remiſſion of ſins, is called the beginning of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God. And the Evangeliſt luke (chap. 1.15.) deſcribing that which qualified John for his miniſtry, tells us in the words which the angel ſpake to his father Zachary, that he was filled with the holy Ghoſt from the womb, for the rendring him a fit meſſenger to usher in the comming of Chriſt in the flesh, by going before him in the ſpirit, and power of Eliah, whoſe work is to reſtore all things, making them right and ſtreight; but he is to leave the work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and miniſtry of the new creature being and life, to the ſon himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſubject which both theſe miniſtries cheifly reſpected, in the day of the diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Chriſts firſt appearance, was the inward man of the heart, for the rooting and grounding it in love, and ſtrengthning it under the many and various trialls of the croſſe, and temptations that were to be undergone. For beleevers are to beare about in their bodyes, the markes of the dying of the Lord Jeſus, whilſt he is in his far countrey. He hath appointed them a warfare to manage with the ruling powers of this world, in a way of Teſtimony or witneſſ-bearing, and therein not to love their lives unto death, but in faith and patience to poſſeſſe their ſoules. Nevertheleſſe, leaſt they might imagine thereupon (as they are too apt to do) that their faith, if it were of the right kind and unfamed, would preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly come forth into its powerfull operation, he warily cautions them therein, and corrects that miſtake, by intimating that this was a thing they were not to expect, till they had shared with him in his ſufferings, continued with him in his temptations, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven proof of their ſervice and obedience to him, in and under the croſſe. For (ſayes he) which of you having a ſervant, plowing or feeding cattel, will ſay to him by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93838:43"/> and by, when he is come from the feild, goe, ſit downe to meat? will he not rather ſay to him, make ready wherewith I may ſup, gird thyſelf and ſerve me, till I have eaten and drunken? Wait but till ſuch time as that which is yet behind of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in my members, by them to be borne, shalbe filled up, and afterwards ye shall eat and drink. The ſeaſon for your eating and drinking with me at my table, in my fathers Kingdom, will then come when the work of faith in you shalbe fulfilled with power, and I shalbe admired in all that do beleeve.</p>
            <p>This is that which is properly to be wrought and effected by Chriſt at his ſecond comming, upon the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, and at the preaching of the everlaſting goſpel, which is not another but the ſame goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God, that the miniſtry of John Baptiſt was ſayd to be the beginning of. But it is called everlaſting, from the differing kind of effect and operation it will have, (eſpecially upon the outward man and ſenſuall part of the mind) from what the diſpenſation of it under Chriſts firſt appearance had. For that which was then ſowne in weakenes, and left the poſſeſſors of it expoſed to various ſufferings from the powers of this world, shall now be raiſed in power at this laſt day; to the clothing and furnishing their very outward man, with an ability to handle the powers of this world, and all adverſaries whatſoever, as they shal ſe good.</p>
            <p>That which for the moſt part is atteined unto, under the diſpenſation of the goſpel, in the day of Chriſts firſt appearance in ſpirit, is but a reſtitution to that which yet is mutable, a repentance and a reformation that in time of triall failes, being repented of and turned from, upon which ſuch perſons ſinke downe into a dreadfull apoſtacy from God, and from the holy commandement delivered to them. But at the day of Chriſts ſecond appearance, the works of righteouſnes shall come forth with power and prevalency, triumphing over ſin in all for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as in true beleevers, but in theſe it shalbe permanent and abiding. The life of the immortall ſeed shall make them perfect in love, and shall by the miniſtry of glory in Chriſts ſecond comming, be made manifeſt and viſible to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye. The sun of it shall never ſet more. This is that which we are commanded to wait for, becauſe it will ſurely come and not tary. He that beleevs will not make haſt, but is taught with the hasband man to wait for this precious fruit of the earth, and to have long patience, till the latter rain be receaved as well as the former.</p>
            <p>Now the receaving of the latter rain is not to be looked for (in the courſe of good husbandry) till the ſeed be in the earth, and hath had its ſeaſon there to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, chang its forme, die, and ſpring up with a new eare againſt the harveſt. Happy shall they be who endure to the end, taking the prophets and other holy men that have gone before them, for an example of long-ſuffering and patience, having heard alſo of the exemplary patience of Job, and ſeen the end of our Lord himſelf, who paſſed this way to the crowne, and warns all his true followers to expect the like.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93838:44"/>
            <p>The work of Eliah, (as hath bin shewed) is to turne men from ſin by repentance, and to cauſe them to returne by faith to the living God, enabling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to performe their whole duty to him, as by his law we are commanded. Our bleſſed ſaviour (Mat. 17.11, 12.) mentions two diſtinct commings of Eliah, or two Eliahs. One Eliah, (ſays he) meaning Iohn Baptiſt, is already come: the other, (meaning that foreruning diſpenſation, that is the beginning of the everlaſting Goſpel) is that which commeth or shall come; and it is to be waited for at the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet. The latter Elias is firſt mention'd by our ſaviour, (v. 11.) that is to come and reſtore all things, or be the preparatory meſſenger to that appearance and comming of our Lord, that shall compleat the reſtitution of all things, (Act. 3.21.) as he hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began. Enoch before the flood Propheſied of this latter comming and appearance of Chriſt, ſaying, behold, the Lord commeth with ten thouſands of his Saincts, Jude v. 14.</p>
            <p>So then, theſe two commings of Eliah anſwer to the two commings of Chriſt, the two dayes of the Son of man, the early and later rain of his firſt and ſecond appearance, both of which make up that one third day above-mention'd, that Hoſea ſpeaks of. John Baptiſt, in his miniſtry, which was the firſt comming of Eliah, was courſely enterteind by Herod, who did to him what he would. But there is another Elias to come, though very much oppoſed by many, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to confound Chriſts words in the fore-mentioned Scripture, as if they were all to be underſtood of John Baptiſts Miniſtry only, and did not aſſert or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Eliahs ſecond comming. But the context makes it plain; Eliah commeth or shall come and reſtore all things. This our Lord ſaid, after they had done what they would to the firſt Eliah, which he acknowledged was come already. And both jews and Chriſtians do underſtand (Mal. 4:5, 6.) of Eliahs ſecond comming, in the end of the world, immediatly before the great and dreadfull day of the Lords ſecond comming, For then the like univerſall corruption, apoſtacy and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yea greater and of a deeper die and malignity (becauſe contracted in times of greater light) then that of the old world in Noahs dayes, will certainly appear, and ſtand in need of ſuch a refining fire as the miniſtry of Eliahs ſecond comming will be found to be, in order to reſtore all things out of that deſperate, evill, and forlorne eſtate. And then shall thoſe that fear the Lord, tread downe the wicked as ashes under the ſoles of their feet; Mal. 4.2, 3.</p>
            <p>This is to be the work of Eliahs ſecond comming; but how, and by what miniſtry shall it be wrought? It will aſſuredly be found to be the beginning of the preaching of the everlaſting Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, of the Goſpel preached by that trumpet that gives the certain ſecond, and makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Sons of God in an immutable everlaſting ſtate of righteouſnes and glory, here upon earth; in a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, which is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93838:44"/> all other Kingdoms, shewing itſelf to be the ſtone cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that will fill the whole earth.</p>
            <p>This everlaſting Goſpel, we are told, (Revel. 14.6, 7.) is to be preached by an angel, flying in the midſt of heaven, that muſt with a loud voice, ſay unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, kindred, tongue and people; fear God and give glory to him, for the houre of his judgment is come This is the houre or the day of that great judgment, wherein God will judg the world by that man which he hath ordeined, Jeſus Chriſt. This houre and day is to have continuance in the courſe of its execution on the earth, for the ſpace of a thouſand years. During this time, the Kingdoms of this world shal become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, as holding of him their univerſall head, and exerciſing all their authority under him; Revel. 11.15. So then, in effect, Chriſt alone shall reigne and be exalted in that day, one Lord and his name one, over all the earth.</p>
            <p>This day is to begin (as hath bin ſaid) with the ſecond comming of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah, and is deſcribed in the Scriptures of truth, as to the ſeverall particulars thereof.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh angel ſounds, by reaſon whereof it comes to paſſe, that there are great voices to be heard in heaven, appointed by Chriſt, (as he is the bright morning ſtar, and head of all Principalities and powers, the true Michael and Archangel) to ſeize upon all ſcepters and governments of this world; to take the Rule and viſible power out of the hands of all the Potentates of the earth, and reaſſume it in ſuch a wonderfull manner into the hands of the holy and elect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, (who under Chriſt are appointed the higheſt and cheif Rulers of the viſible world) that by the aſtonishing diſpenſations of Gods providence in that ſeaſon, it will appear and be acknowledged, that Chriſt hath begun and entered upon the taking to himſelf his great power, in order to exerciſe his viſible Rule, as the great, only and univerſall King over all the earth. This he will do, to the intent that the living may know, that the moſt high ruleth in the Kingdom of men, giving it to whomſoever he will. Yea, it shalbe acknowledged and ſeen that under the moſt high, the heavens do rule, Dan. 4.26. All matters shall at that time be carried on in the earth, viſibly, by the decree of the watchers, (v. 17.) the ſupream counſell and ſenate of judicature wherein the holy angels shall ſit and exerciſe juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction under Chriſt, for the good of his church on earth. They are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits in this very reſpect, ſent forth and authorized for this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even to miniſter for them who shalbe heirs of ſalvation; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; all things are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. In that day (ſaith Chriſt) for braſſe I will bring gold, and for yron I will bring ſilver, for wood braſſe, and for ſtones yron; (ſo glorious will then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of al things be) and I will alſo make thine officers peace, and thine
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93838:45"/> exactours righteouſnes. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, waſting not deſtruction within thy borders, but thou shalt call thy walls of defence, ſalvation; and thy gates of juſtice, prayſe. Then the haughtines of man shalbe layd low, and his lofty lookes brought downe; and the worshippers of idols shall goe into the holes of the rocks and caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and of the glory of his majeſty, when he shall thus ariſe moſt terribly to shake the earth; Eſay, 2. The ſame thing is promiſed, Haggai 2:6, 7. Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, the ſea, and the dry land. And I will shake all nations, and the deſire of all nations shall come; that is to ſay, after the terrible, forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſpenſation, miniſtred by Eliah, (that went up to heaven in a fiery chariot to take his ſeat amongſt this heavenly colledge of angels, and be in that glory with other the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,) shall the deſire of all nations (Chriſt himſelf) come, to perfect and conſummate what is left wanting in the operation of the former miniſtry, and fill his owne houſe with glory in the ſight of the whole world, during the ſpace of a thouſand years.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But 2dly, although at the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, it do come to paſſe that there be great voices in heaven, what is that to the inhabitants that are on earth, thoſe that are at home in the body, abſent from the Lord, whoſe ſpirits are faſt aſleep in the earth, to wit, in the organicall life and exerciſe of bodily ſenſes? Will not they be out of the hearing of the ſound of theſe heavenly voices? At leaſt, will they be able to underſtand their meaning, unleſſe what is uttered by the ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tongues, be in words eaſy to be underſtood by the ſpirit of their minds who live and dwell in mortall clay, and that an eaſy underſtanding thereof alſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the ſenſuall part of the ſoule, which is as the door to take in and give out againe, what shalbe heard by the ſound of ſuch a heavenly Trumpet? By what is recorded for our inſtruction, we may be aſſured, this is not impoſſible nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. It hapned thus to the Apoſtle John, before his change by death, even whilſt he was a priſoner and a banished man in the Ile of Patmos, for the Word of God and teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt. He looked, and behold a door was opened in heaven. By the opening of that door, he came to be made able to hear the voices in heaven, the firſt and ſecond voice of the angel (Revel: 4.1. 10:8.) as it were of a trumpet, talking with him, which ſayd, come up hither, and I will shew thee things which muſt be hereafter. By the power of that voice calling him, he was immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſpirit, that is, as Paul, abſent from the body. He had ſuch an awakening of his inward ſenſes wrought in him, ſuch an opening and making of them meet to heare and receave what by the tongue of the angel was to be delivered, that he was in the ſpirit, or in the exerciſe of the ſame kind of life and manner of converſing with ſpirits, that they are in one with another, or that the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect do uſe with the holy angels, when in the ſtate of ſoules ſeperate from the body, made equall to angels, and children of the reſurrection, in the firſt degree or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93838:45"/> ſtep of it, which is called (Revel. 20) the firſt Reſurrection. The Apoſtle does there ſpeak of the time, when this way of heavenly converſe between the ſaincts that are on earth and the holy angels, shalbe frequent and uſuall, and no ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſtrang thing, as yet by moſt it is accounted.</p>
            <p>This will be brought to paſſe by the opening of the door in heaven, interpreted by Chriſt himſelf, (Jo. 1.51.) in his anſwer to Nathaniel. Becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the fig-tree, beleeveſt thou? Thou shalt ſe greater things then theſe. What greater things? A door open in heaven, as a means of eaſy and familiar entercourſe between the inhabitants of heaven and dwellers on earth. The angels are to be employed as meſſengers of intelligence between Chriſt and his Saincts, before the time of his owne perſonall converſe with them on earth. For (ſaith Chriſt) verily, verily, I ſay unto you; Hereafter you shall ſe heaven open, (or the gate and door that is made into it and kept open by me) for the aſcent and deſcent of my holy angels, between me and my Saincts on earth. At that day Chriſt wilbe glorified in his Saincts, and honour them in the ſight of them that hate them: God will anſwer them before they pray; whilſt they are yet ſpeaking, he will heare, and ſpeedily avenge them of their adverſaries. He will grant them the deſire of their hearts.</p>
            <p>But when will this day be, that theſe great and wonderfull things shalbe ſeen? The text is plain and expreſſe, Revel. 11. Tis evidently to begin at the riſing of the witneſſes, who shall immediatly upon their riſing, be thus in the ſpirit, as John was on the Lords day, in the Ile of Patmos. This wil be the proper and uſuall diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in that day of the Lord, that is to begin at the ſounding of the ſeventh trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. The ſpirit of life from God shall then enter into the witneſſes, ſet them upon their feet, and immediatly qualify them to be in the ſpirit, or have their inward ſenſes awakened and fitted to hear and receave meſſages from heaven, and the knowledg of the mind of their Lord, by the immediate impreſſion and inſpiration of angels, employed by him for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We know this was frequently the caſe with Daniel and moſt of the other dear ſervants and prophets of the Lord. Unto Jacob this great myſtery and truth was moſt particularly and diſtinctly foretold in the ladder which he ſaw, the feet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of touched the earth and the top of it reached to heaven, and behold, the angels aſcending and deſcending upon it, and the Lord himſelf ſtanding above, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by that means unto Jacob, acquainting him thereby with his mind, and giving to him moſt rich and precious promiſes. The interpretation of this ladder was not only made by our ſaviour to Nathaniel, as we have opened, but it was at the ſame time given to Iacob with the viſion itſelf, as appears by the Reſult that came into his mind thereupon, when he ſayd, How dreadfull is this place? It is the very houſe of God, where his throne is. It is the very gate of heaven, through which by the miniſtry of angels (in the hand of Chriſt, as he is the ſon of man, and hath the uſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93838:46"/> and exerciſe of all kinds of humane ſenſe, in perfection, in his glorified manhood) the inward and outward man of the ſaincts shalbe ſo affected, changed, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as to give them a kind of entrance into, and a being in heaven, even whilſt they are yet here in the body.</p>
            <p>This Chriſt wrought and obteined the power of, when he aſcended up above all heavens, and as man, did come to have a more excellent name then the angels. Now that he aſcended, what is it, but that he (who was in the forme of God, and counted it not robbery to be equall with God) did firſt deſcend lower then the angels, into the fashion of an earthly man, the lowermoſt part of his habitable earth, (Prov: 8:31.) even the animalish and ſenſuall nature of man, uſing and exerciſing as well the bodily as ſpirituall ſenſes, appertaining to the very naturall man. When he had done this, by laying hold on the ſeed of Abraham, and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it into perſonall union with himſelf, he ſet up that ladder in his owne perſon; the feet whereof ſtand on the earth, whilſt the top of it enters into the higheſt heaven. For he that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended far above all heavens, that he might fill and fulfill all things. That therefore which Jacob pronounced in the ſpirituall interpretation of his viſion, is moſt undeniable. This is none other (ſayes he) then the houſe of God, the building not made with hands, whoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maker is God; the fathers houſe, wherein are many manſions, built by the eternall WORD and wiſdom of the father, in the perſon of the mediatour, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as he is the firſt borne of every creature, and the beginning or firſt begotten from the dead, (Col. 1.) in whom is that life that is the light of men, who was before all things, and by whom all things conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The way for God (that is the high and lofty one, inhabiting eternity) to deſcend and come to dwell in the humble, broken and contrite ſpirit, as the place of his reſt; and the way for the humble, poor, and broken ſpirit to aſcend into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſight of God; all this was wrought out in our nature, by the WORD that made himſelf flesh, and in that body, died, roſe again and aſcended where he was before, as in the volume of Gods book it is written of him. This he told his owne diſciples (Jo. 14.) In my fathers houſe are many manſions. If it were not ſo, I would have told you. Behold, I go to prepare a place for you; to ſet the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by which the aſcent and deſcent is contrived into my fathers houſe, for ſuch as you are. And if I goe and prepare a place for you, you may be ſure I will come againe, and gather you unto my ſelf, that where J am, ye may be alſo. At his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming again, the ſame Apoſtle John finds the thing to be true, that his Lord had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. For (Revel. 11.12, 19.) it appears that upon the riſing of the witneſſes and ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, the temple of God wilbe opened in heaven (which is the ſame opening of the heavens before-mentioned, (Jo. 1.51.) and there wilbe ſeen in his temple the arke of his Teſtament, the law of the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, written in the heart of Chriſt the Son of Man, from whoſe preſence the fiery
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93838:46"/> law is to be diſpenſed by the miniſtry of angels, at which there wilbe lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earth quake and great haile.</p>
            <p>The door into heaven being thus ſet open, the riſen witneſſes are ſpoken to, (v. 12.) ſaying, come up hither, or be with me in the ſpirit, in a mind fitted to enterteine converſe with me, by the miniſtry of the holy angels. And for ſuch a bleſſing and benefit, be not unwilling (as often as there shalbe occaſion) to be abſent from the body, that you may be preſent with the Lord. For if herein you should appear vile in the eyes of wordly men, as men beſide yourſelvs, as David did in dancing naked before the arke; yet is it to God. And when you change againe from that inwardnes of life with God, to be more in outward converſe with men, and more ſober in their thoughts, it is for their ſakes, and for their great benefit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then yours, that thereby you may be able to turn many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to righteouſnes.</p>
            <p>In this ſence, (not excluding the literall) it will be found true, that the ſaincts shalbe called to be and live in the ſpirit with Chriſt, and to walk with God on earth, before their tranſlation, as Enoch did. Anſwerable to this, it is ſaid, Dan. 12.2. compared with 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. And many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, shall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to shame and everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. The ſpirit of our mind which ſleepes in the duſt of the earth, wilbe wrought off from that love and delight it is apt to take in making the body its home, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting itſelf in ſuch kind of operations as are in and by the uſe of our bodily organs, and wilbe gathered and carried up by the miniſtry of the holy angels, (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a meetnes in the ſenſes of the inward man of the heart) into a converſe with them, and with Chriſt himſelf in ſpirit, as a better home and city of habitation then that of the duſt of the earth, wherein it hath bin ſo long an inhabitant. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, the ſoule will be endued or clothed upon with a hearing eare and a ſpeaking tongue, like to that of the angels, in their immutable ſtate. And for this ſelf ſame thing we are wrought by God, who hath given us the earneſt of his ſpirit already inſome degree, but will give it in the higheſt degree and meaſure it is atteinable before the change that comes upon us by death, when this body is to be layd downe and brought into a ſtate of actuall ſeparation from the ſoule. This change by death, unto thoſe that have partaken firſt of this awakening, shalbe very eaſy, like unto the tranſlation of Enoch, who ſaw not death, or had no ſenſe of it in a way of pain or horrour. His paſſage was ſudden and in a moment, very eaſy and deſireable. The Apoſtle Paul therefore, ſpeaking of this kind of change, that should happen at the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, even in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, (as we have opened) does ſay; behold I shew you a myſtery, that which as yet is a great ſecret, but hereafter shalbe very commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced; we shall not all ſleepe, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, at the laſt trump. For the trumpet shall ſound, and the dead shalbe rayſed incorruptible. Thoſe whoſe ſpirits were before, as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93838:47"/>
'twere, aſleepe in the duſt of the earth, and dead in reſpect of the ſpirituality and heavenlines they are now awaken'd into, wilbe acknowledged as in that kind and degree of reſurrection, which wilbe made knowne at the riſing of the witneſſes. They shall not die, that is, leave the body with any painfull ſenſe of death, but in a moment shalbe changed and tranſlated into glory. This awakned, riſen ſtate, is not that which shalbe peculiar only to the ſaincts; but wicked men, the children of perdition, in way of everlaſting contempt, shall alſo partake of it, with a like way of operation upon the ſpirit of their minds, by wicked angels, transforming themſelvs into angels of light, and hoping by this means to gaine credit to their miniſters as miniſters of righteouſnes alſo, which in a way of counterfeit reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, the father of deceit wilbe preparing, during this miniſtry of Eliah, till he be bound up by Chriſt from any more deceaving of the nations in this kind, or any other.</p>
            <p>This the Apoſtle Paul does very cleerly intimate, (1 Cor: 13.7.) where he admits, there may be thoſe that may ſpeake not only with tongues of men, but alſo of angels, who yet not having or living in the ſpirit of love, there deſcribed, will be found to be but as ſounding braſſe and tinckling cymballs, veſſels of great contempt, compared with thoſe that make the right and true muſick, (Revel. 14.) thoſe harpers that are taught how to ſing the ſong of Moſes and of the lamb in sweet harmony and conſortship together, and thereby turne many to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, who shall shine like bright morning ſtars.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third particular then, that shalbe an eminent effect of Eliahs ſecond comming, is the rayſing up in the world a more excellent way of preaching, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and obeying the goſpel, then ever yet hath bin knowne upon the face of the earth; even that which (Rom. 11.15.) is deſervedly called life from the dead, and is to be the means of bringing in the fullnes both of jew and gentile. This is darkly pointed out by Dives in the parable (Luk. 16.30.) when in his anſwer to Abraham, he ſayes, that if one went to his brethren from the dead, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, hereby glancing (as 't were) at ſuch a kind of excellent and powerfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as was intended by God to be ſet up in the world, whereby to bring men to repentence, or as Luk. 14.23. to compel them to come in, that Gods houſe may be filled with the fullnes both of jew and gentile.</p>
            <p>This kind of miniſtry is that, wherein both for cleernes and certainty of the matter preached, and the power of that ſpirit in which it is miniſtred, shalbe beyond all that hath yet bin ſeen or experienced in the church. For in this day the heavens shalbe commanded to drop downe from above, and the skies to poure downe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, and the earth to open and bring forth ſalvation, that righteouſnes from heaven and in the earth may ſpring up together, and this by the Lords owne moſt powerfull forming and creation, Eſay. 45.8. So Pſal. 50.1, 6. The Lord, the mighty God hath ſpoken, and called the earth from the riſing of the Son to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93838:47"/> going downe thereof. Out of Sion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. Our God shall come and shall keepe no longer ſilence. A fire shall devoure before him, and it shalbe very tempeſtous round about him. He shall call to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens from above, or make uſe of the angelicall miniſtry in the judging of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples cauſe for them, as thoſe that he will firſt employ to go before him and declare his righteouſnes, and then afterwards will he come in his owne perſonall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and shew that he is judge himſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſt will give the angels a call, nay, a command and commiſſion, to prepare the hearts and mouthes of the ſaincts, as trumpets, through which they may give a certain ſound, to the making manifeſt the knowledg and viſion of God and of his law in both his Covenants, ſo plaine, that thoſe who run, may read it. And unto this ſelfſame thing, the heart and mouth of thoſe that God will think fit to uſe in this miniſtry, shalbe wrought by Chriſt ſpirit, as the moſt glorious earneſt they can receave here on earth of the life in glory, which they shall for ever enjoy with Chriſt in heaven. For it shall come to paſſe, that thoſe who are thus called into this miniſtry, shalbe found ſpeaking with the tongues, not of men only, but of angels, and to have alſo the love requiſite to diſtinguish them from all counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits. Yea, they shall have this love of Chriſt and the ſpirit of it perfected in them, to the caſting out of all torment and feare, making them bold as a lion, fearing the face neither of devils nor of men, in the diſcharge of this their miniſtry, which shalbe ſo powerfull as to turne many, even innumerable multitudes to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to the admiration of all beholders. The Gentiles shal come to this light, and Kings to the brightnes of the very riſing thereof Then shalt thou ſe and flow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged, becauſe the noiſe or abundance of the ſea shalbe turned towards thee, (or multitudes and prophane perſons who before were to be ſeen foaming out their owne filth, shall now be converted to thee) the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee, Eſay: 60:5. And not the Gentiles only, but the Jews alſo, (or the myſticall earthly Jeruſalem, conſiſting both of Jews and Gentiles) that earth shalbe made to bring forth in one day, that nation shalbe borne at once. That Zion, ſo ſoon as she travels, shall bring forth her children, whoſe wall the ſons of ſtrangers shall build up, and their Kings shall miniſter unto her. For in my wrath ſayth the Lord, I have ſmote thee, but in my favour I have had mercy on thee. Therefore thy gates shalbe open continually, they shall not be shut day nor night, that may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles and their Kings with them. For the nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee, shall perish. Yea thoſe nations shalbe utterly waſted. In theſe beleevers shall Chriſt be admired, and to the exerciſe of their faith all things shalbe poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The power of the keyes shalbe ſo committed to them as is promiſed, that whatſoever they bind or looſe on earth, shall be bound and looſed in the heaven. Theſe will be found to be the angels that come forth out of the temple, with the ſeven
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93838:48"/> vials of Gods wrath, commiſſionated to poure them out upon the beaſt, the whore, the falſe Prophet, and the whole Kingdom of Antichriſt. They shall not need to take care, as to what they are to ſpeak and anſwer for themſelvs, when they are brought before Magiſtrates for Chriſts name ſake, for in that houre a mouth and wiſdom shalbe given unto them, which their enemies shall not be able to reſiſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third particular that shall accompany the ſecond comming of Eliah, is the necceſſary conſequent and product, that shall and muſt attend the excellent and powerfull miniſtry, above made knowne; For it is by the breath of this mouth of the Lord in his ſervants, (the loud, plaine and certaine ſound of this ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, even when it begins to ſound) that Jacob muſt ariſe, as low and as ſmall as he and the diſperſed ſeed of God will at that time be judged to be, in the eye of the world, or in their owne ſight, Ezek. 37.11. Theſe bones, however they ſeeme to be dried up, muſt live; and by this breath of propheſy from the Lord, that is to enter into them, they shall once againe ſtand upon their feet, with that firmnes and ſtability, as never to fall more.</p>
            <p>When the command is once given for the ſpirit of prophecy to come forth in that excellent and powerfull way of miniſtry before-mentioned; it will firſt make a great noiſe amongſt the inhabitants of the world. It wilbe a voyce of noiſe from the city, a voyce from the temple, a voyce of the Lord, rendring recompence to his enemies. And after the noiſe, which shalbe occaſioned by this voice of the Lords ſecond appearance, (to the great joy of his ſaints, and utter shame of his and their enemies) there shall immediatly follow a great shaking or earth quake, where in a tenth part of the city shall fall, to make way for the more eaſy and ready comming together of the dry bones, which will thus gradually become an exceeding great multitude, in excellent order. For firſt, the ſinews and flesh will come upon them, and the skin will cover them above, but no breath in them yet. This is a typicall deſcription of the ſtate of the witneſſes, who do for a ſeaſon lie as it were breathleſſe and dead in the ſtreet of the great city, ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt. But upon the command given to the breath of propheſy, that was called from the foure winds, to breath upon theſe ſlain, and cauſe them to live, the breath comes into them, and they live and ſtand upon their feet, an exceeding great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, even theſe dry bones of the whole houſe of Iſrael, who looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs a little before, as thoſe whoſe bones were dried, whoſe hope was loſt, and who were cut off for their parts. For at this time, God will open as it were the very graves of his people, and cauſe them to come out from thence into their owne land, the land of the promiſed ſpirit, Emmanuells land, by putting (after this admirable and extraordinary manner) his ſpirit within them, that shalbe in them and to them, as life from the dead, cauſing them to know that the Lord hath opened their graves fro them, and brought them into their owne land, by vertue of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93838:48"/> that he hath made with them, and hath ſet his ſanctuary in the midſt of them for evermore.</p>
            <p>The Lord in this day will performe the word ſpoken by the Prophet Micah, (chap. 2:12, 13.) I will ſurely aſſemble, O Iacob, all of thee. I will ſurely gather the remnant of Iſrael. I will put them together as the sheep of the flock, in the midſt of their fold. They shall make a great noiſe by reaſon of the multitude of men. The breaker up is come up before them: they have broken up and have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorow the gate, and are gone out by it, and their king shall paſſe before them, and the Lord on the head of them. For the children of Iſraell shall abide many dayes without a King, Prince, or ſacrifice, image, Ephod, or Teraphim. And afterward, shall they return, and ſeeke the Lord their God; and David their King, and shall fear the Lord and his goodnes in the latter dayes, when the Mountaine of the houſe of the Lord shalbe eſtablished upon the top of the Mountains, and the las shall goe out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Ieruſalem, Eſai. 2. And I will aſſemble her that halts, and will gather her that I have driven out, and her that I have afflicted, and will make of the one a remnant, and of the other a ſtrong nation, and the Lord shall reigne over them in mount Zion, from thenceforth even for ever. And nation shall not life up a ſword againſt nation, neither shall they learn war any more. For all people will walk in the name of their God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God, for ever and ever. For a ſmall moment I have forſaken thee and hid my face from thee, but with great mercies and everlaſting kindneſſes will I gather thee. For thy maker is thy husband, the Lord of hoaſts is his name; and thy Redeemer, the holy one of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth shal he be called. Behold, they shall ſurely gather together, but not by me. Whoſoever shall gather together againſt thee, shall fall for thy ſake. For all thy children shalbe taught of the Lord, and great shalbe the peace of them. In righteouſnes shall they be eſtablished. They shalbe far from oppreſſion, feare or terrour. No weapon that is formed againſt thee, shall proſper, and every tongue that shall riſe up in judgement againſt thee, thou shalt condemne. This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, and their righteouſnes is of me, ſaith the Lord. This is Iſrael my ſervant, Jacob whom I have choſen, and the ſeed of Abraham, my freind.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more like precious promiſes we meet with in the Scripturs, concerning a moſt proſperous and glorious ſtate, that shall viſibly come upon Gods people even in this world, according to the aſſurance thereof given unto Abraham, that he in his ſeed should be heir of the world. All theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are reducible only to the ſtate of thoſe times that shall certainly be brought upon the ſtage of this world, when the Kingdom and ſecond appearance of the great God and our ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt, shall shine forth in its brightnes upon earth.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:93838:49"/>
            <p>This is that which is not only promiſed ſo very often, and teſtified by all the Prophets, but was much ſpoken of and beleeved amongſt the Jews before Chriſts comming in the flesh. It was univerſally receaved alſo in the firſt age after Chriſt, and all were accounted hereticks and deniers of the reſurrection that did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it. And in that great Council of Nice, called by Conſtantine the great, it was aſſerted in an article of their Eccleſiaſticall doctrine, to this effect; That by foreknowledg God did not make the world in that height of perfection at firſt, which he intended to bring it unto in the end, becauſe he foreſaw, man would ſin. Therefore (ſay they) we expect new heavens and a new earth, according to the ſcriptures. And then (as Daniel ſayes) the ſaincts of the moſt high shall take the Kingdom, and there shalbe a pure and holy world, a Land of the living and not of the dead. This David by the eye of faith foreſaw, when he ſayd, I shall ſe the goodnes of the Lord in the land of the living, the land of the humble and meeke. Bleſſed are the meeke, for they shall inherit the earth, and be clothed, beautified and adorned with ſalvation. So Eſay. 26. The foot shall tread downe the lofty city, even the feet of the poor and the ſteps of the needy.</p>
            <p>This great truth, was thus witneſſed unto, then, and afterwards alſo, till the adverſaries knew no other way to avoyd it, but by denying the book of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to be ſcripture.</p>
            <p>In the beginning alſo of the reformation in England, in a catechiſme ſet forth in Edward the ſixths time, and by him authorized the laſt year of his reigne, that part of the Lords prayer, Thy Kingdom come, is thus commented upon. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we ſe not all things put under the feet of Chriſt; we do not yet ſe that ſtone cut out of the mountaine without any work or endeavours of man, that is to breake and diſſipate into nothing the great image deſcribed by Daniel, that the little ſtone which is Chriſt, may poſſeſſe and obtein the empire of the whole world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the graunt of the father. Antichriſt is not yet deſtroyed, whence it is, that we are to deſire and pray, that in Gods due time it may be done, and that Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone way reigne with his Saints, according to his divine promiſes; that he may live and reigne on the earth, according to the laws of the holy Scriptures, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the traditions and lawes of men, and the tyrannicall will of this world. So have we it, in that Catechiſme.</p>
            <p>Another paſſage there is, relating to this ſubject in the ſame book, upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the laſt judgment, diſtinguishing between the end of the world, and the laſt generall judgment, ſaying, that the holy Scriptures call the end of the world, the time of conſummation, the full filling of the Kingdom and myſteries of Chriſt, in the reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all things. It ſeemes bu agreable to reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the dayes should come, wherein the corruption, chang, and ſin, to which the whole world hath bin heither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjected, should ceaſe. This shall be done by fire, as gold is refined, by which it shalbe brought to its laſt and higheſt perfection. And this, man, the leſſer world,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93838:49"/> shall much more experience, in being freed from the bondage of corruption, and brought into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God. For mans ſake therefore the viſible frame of heaven and earth shalbe renewed with a much more pleaſant and beautifull face or for me, then it had before. But ſecondly, as to the laſt and generall judgment, the anſwer is; Chriſt shall come, at whoſe voice the dead shall ariſe, and be made perfect in ſoule and body. And he shall ſit on the throne of his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, ſeen by the whole world, and pronounce the finall ſentence, upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of every ones conſcience, out of his owne mouth. Then the Sons of God shall compleatly poſſeſſe that Kingdom of immortality and eternall life, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them before the foundation of the world, and shall reigne with Chriſt unto all eternity. But the wicked, which do not beleeve, shalbe caſt into eternall fire, appointed for the devil and his angels.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction between the dayes of the end of the world, and the work proper to them (called the laſt dayes, and the great day of eternity, or the laſt judgment) is well explained and cleered by Mr. Mede, who gives the account before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in theſe things. In a word, he declares his judgment to be; that the ſeventh trumpet, or thouſand years reigne of Chriſt on earth, conteined therein, is that great day of the Lord, the day of his Judgment, ſo much celebrated among the Jews in their writings, and from them taken up by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, not a day of a few houres, (as ſome ſuppoſe) but a continued interval of many years, (wherein Chriſt shall firſt deſtroy all his enemies, even death itſelf) and shall end with the univerſall reſurrection and and paſſing of the finall ſentence, winding up all in the reſigning up of his Kingdom to the father, that God may be all in all. Thus the thouſand years is no diſtinct time from the day of Judgment, neither before it nor after; but the ſame with it, the whole time, during which this great day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does continue, in the very beginning whereof, Antichriſt shall finally be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and not before. Theſe therefore, in Scripture, are called the times of Chriſts Kingdom, wherein he will shew himſelf the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and this for the ſpace of a thouſand years, in the laſt period of which, comes the laſt and finall ſentence (before mentioned) to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and executed.</p>
            <p>The reaſon therefore why the excellent promiſes (above recited) are not yet performed, is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The times for their performance are not yet fully come, though very neer. But moſt certaine it is (as we have heard) that they shall and will come.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Becauſe the ſeed alſo to which they are made, is not yet come to be made manifeſt as they shalbe, in diſtinction from all counterfeits and falſe pretenders, which ſay they are Jews and are not, but do lie. This diſcrimination, and certaine, cleare diſcovery of the true ſeed of God from the falſe, will be begun to be made by the miniſtry of Eliah, or the miniſtry that shall riſe up in the ſpirit and powers already diſcribed.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93838:50"/>
            <p>This excellent miniſtry muſt and wilbe attended with a church of ſaints anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which shall conſiſt of the riſen witneſſes, the dry bones that this ſpirit of propheſy brings out of their graves, from the foure winds of heaven, cauſing them to ſtand againe upon their feet, an exceeding great army. All of them are to be quickned by the means of this powerfull and glorious miniſtry, with a ſpirit of life from God, that enters into them, and shews itſelf to be that life from the dead in them, which is never more ſubject to corruption. It is unto theſe alſo, that God ſayes by a great voyce from heaven, (which they are fitted with ears to heare) come up hither, and they do accordingly aſcend up to heaven in a cloud, their enemies beholding them; or rather, heaven is brought downe into their knowledg and poſſeſſion here on earth, whilſt as yet they are clouded with their mortall body, which (nevertheles) shall at laſt be changed in a moment, and they not ſe death. In the meane time, they shall experience their very mortall body freed from the bondage of corruption, and reſtored to the primitive purity, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, uſe and ſerviceablenes unto the mind, which it had in paradiſe in the perſons of our firſt parents, before the fall. And to theſe shall it be given to ſe the opening of the heavens, long ſince promiſed by Chriſt, and the temple of God that is there, opened alſo, and in the temple the arke of the Teſtament, both which (Revel. 15.5.) are put together, and called the temple of the tabernacle of the Teſtimony in heaven, which in that day shalbe opened; the true tabernacle or ſanctuary, which God pitch'd and not man; Heb. 8.2. In this temple dwelleth the fulnes of the God head bodily, the viſion whereof is to be made plaine to the eye of our ſenſuall part, or to our inward bodily ſenſes, that by ſeing the mind of God in ſuch legible characters in the ſpirit and perſon of Chriſt, the like mind may be found and ſeen in all that are his, who are then to appeare in the ſame likenes, by ſeing him as he is.</p>
            <p>That which Chriſt is, and in ſpirit shalbe ſeen to be, as the mind of the father is wrought out in him, the Apoſtle Paul points out, Philip. 2.5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is in the forme of God, the WORD of life, who was in the beginning, was with God, and was God. And thus conſidered, he accounts it not robbery to be Gods equall.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, In the diſpenſation of the fulnes of time, the ſame that is in the forme of God, is alſo found in fashion as a man, and is made flesh, with the uſe of a living ſoule, in the very earthly and outward ſenſes of it, bearing the form and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the firſt Adam in his primitive purity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He that thus deſcended into flesh, and the lowermoſt parts of his habitable earth, (in which earthly make and nature, he became inferiour to angels, for the ſuffering of death) is the ſame that out of this does aſcend, and is exalted far above all heavens, by being made in his humane ſpirit, ſoule and body, the temple wherein all the fulnes of the God head dwells bodily, and a meet veſſel to receave, poſſeſſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93838:50"/> and be the miniſter of it unto others. He is the WORD of life, the brightnes of the fathers glory, the expreſſe character of his ſubſtance, by which this manhood is ſealed and made heavenly, partaking with the living WORD, as he is the Angel of Gods preſence, in whom is Gods name. He is the cheif and higheſt Angel, and as ſuch, is head of all principalities and power. And over and above all this, in his archangelicall eſtate, he is the true Michael, Gods equall, the man that is made Gods fellow, or ſecond in the ſame divine throne of glory.</p>
            <p>In theſe three cheif particulars, Chriſt, the temple of God in heaven, shalbe ſeen and made manifeſt, as that which he is and will witnes himſelf to be, in the hearts of all true beleevers, the ſons of his love, that are to be are his likenes, and to be ſeen with his name and ſuperſcription upon them. In this reſpect it is, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that commandement, 1 John. 4:20, 21. that he who loveth God in Chriſt, love his brother alſo, which thoſe that doe not, will thereby prove themſelvs liars, if they ſay they love God. For how can he love God or Chriſt, whom he hath not ſeen, that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen? There is a day comming, when that which Chriſt wilbe ſeen to be in himſelf, he wilbe ſeen to be alſo in his members, that shalbe receaved and gathered unto him, as joynt heirs and poſſeſſours of his fathers love and glory. When Chriſt, who is their life, shall ſo appear, they shall alſo appear with him in glory. They shall no longer remaine in their hidden and concealed ſtate, wherein they are judged according to men in the flesh, whilſt they live according to God in the ſpirit. Nor shall they any longer be like Princes wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on foot, whilſt Servants ride on horſe back.</p>
            <p>Behold then, upon the opening of the temple of God in heaven, the powerfull and glorious effects that the miniſtry of the ſpirit, flowing from thence, shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and be accompanied with, for the making manifeſt the true Iſrael of God.</p>
            <p>The Lord himſelf will deſcend, firſt, with the voice of the Archangel, that laſt and moſt glorious trump of God, Chriſts humanity, as head of the elect Angels, all principalities and powers being ſubjected unto him, who as he is the Son of man, is made the cheif of the a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels, and the prime miniſter of the WORD of life, for food unto them. This beginning of the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, is that which (as hath bin ſaid) is the miniſtry of Eliah, and goes before the miniſtry that shalbe immediately exerciſed by the Son himſelf in his owne perſon. By Chriſts revealing himſelf from heaven, the head of angels, he employes them as his reapers in the end of the world or in the laſt times, to ſever the wicked from among the juſt, and gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend. He will ſend a quickning Spirit of life from his preſence, that will breath the breath of prophecy into the holy angels, thoſe voices that are to be heard in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying, The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt. Theſe voices wilbe heard, as it were the voice of a Trumpet, talking with the Saincts on earth, and calling them up into the ſame heavenly converſe with themſelvs, cauſing them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93838:51"/> immediatly thereupon, to be in the ſpirit, beholding the throne that is in heaven, and him that ſits thereon, as the head of thoſe holy and bleſſed ſpirits, who are all deſirous to do him homage and worship, refuſing to take that to themſelvs which is due only to their head, and which the ſaints themſelvs on earth, would be but too forward to give them, as was the caſe of John, Revel. 22.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Under this miniſtry and diſpenſation, the church and every particular member thereof, do become the children that are all taught of God, inwardly, by this heavenly breath or angelical inſpiration. For this qualifies and enables them by the ſight of the juſt one, to know the mind and will of God, and to do and fulfill it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, as they ſe he hath done it before them, with a heart and ſpirit like unto his, as he is the ſon of man. And as ſo conſidered, he is head of the holy angels, by them ſpeaking to and inſpiring the church on earth. He is alſo the head of that church in God the father, that is above the angels, ſo as unto principalities and powers, the very elect angels, by the church in this ſence, (even the generall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the firſt borne, whoſe names are written in heaven) the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God shalbe made knowne. By theſe divine men, who are the bride the lambs wife, he will shew himſelf ſpeaking and inſpiring the good angels in heaven, to all eternity, and judging the evill and wicked ones into the flames of eternall fire.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe attainments, is that wherein the lower and common ranke of beleevers (called in ſcripture, the fulnes of the gentiles, compared with the true Jews, Gods firſt borne ſons) are gathered into ſociety with the holy angels, into a copartnership with them, in an immutability of righteouſnes and glory, and ſo into Chriſt their head, as into their proper element and ſphere, in which they are rayſed up to live in his ſight, and to eat and drink with him at his table, in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kingdom, to all eternity. Over theſe the ſecond death never hath power. And this is called the firſt reſurrection, which the other ſort of beleevers, thoſe that are the fulnes of the Jews, do enjoy in common with them, during the thouſand years reigne of Chriſt on earth. And after that, they have a farther aſcent into the life and glory of the ſecond reſurrection, which is not to be revealed in the power of it, untill Chriſt have reſigned up the Kingdom unto his father, that God may be all in all.</p>
            <p>But during the thouſand years reigne of Chriſt on earth, both theſe houſes of Iſrael shalbe gathered as sheep under one head and shepheard, into one sheepfold, and shine forth only in the life and glory of the firſt reſurrection, witneſſing to the headship of Chriſt, which he exerciſeth over the angels, and by them, over the very church itſelf, whilſt the Kingdom of the ſon is unreſigned by him into the hands of the father.</p>
            <p>The life and glory of both theſe reſurrections (whether as they reſpect the mind or body of the true ſaincts and children of God, or both) is that immortality which is brought to light by Jeſus Chriſt, the life from the dead, which will shew
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93838:51"/> itſelf in the times appointed thereunto, and tranſlate us at length into eternity, where time shalbe no more. And we are begotten (even while here in our mortall bodies) through fellowship with Chriſt in his reſurrection, unto a lively hope of this inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, which fades not away, ready to be revealed in theſe laſt times. Untill then, it is in faith only, and the ſeed of it does beget and produce the two ſorts of beleevers, ſo frequently mentioned, who now by this miniſtry of Eliah are beginning to be made manifeſt, and shalbe diſtinguished as the true Iſrael of God, from all ſtrangers and deceitfull workers whatſoever, that either love or make a lie.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe, are in their principles ſaid to be of the common faith, and to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>teined the common ſalvation. Thus Paul writes to Titus, as his ſon after the common faith Tit. 1:4. And Jude (v. 3.) ſayes, I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common ſalvation, to the fulfilling of the ſcripture, (Rom. 4:17. Gen. 17.5.) ſpeaking of Abraham; I have made thee the father of many nations, as wel as of one nation peculiar, above and beſides all the reſt. For ſo Abrahams ſeed was to be a ſeed made up of many nations, and a ſeed of one more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly beloved nation alſo, that were to be ſeperated to him, to dwell by themſelvs and not be reckon'd amongſt the nations that are the fulnes of the Gentiles. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is but the typicall father, Chriſt is the father in ſpirit and truth to this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſeed. In Gen. 13. and 15. chapters, God promiſed Abraham, to make of him a great people, numberleſſe as the duſt of the earth or the ſtars of heaven, which he makes good in the fulnes of the true Jews. But (chap. 17.5.) he gives an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſeed alſo, which he there promiſes him, beſides what he promiſed before, ſaying, behold, my Covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a high father of a multitude of nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, that is high father, but Abraham, high father of multitudes. Hence is it, that in Gods everlaſting Covenant, there comes to be found ſalvation for a multitude of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, common (as it were) to all mankind, if the fault be not in themſelvs, and not ſalvation only for one great nation, the Iſrael that is Gods firſt borne.</p>
            <p>God hath therefore an everlaſting love and ſalvation, which comparatively ſpoken of, is that which is common and extenſive to a numberleſſe multitude, that he ſaves out of all people and nations, kindreds and tongues, that are upon the face of the earth, who yet are not brought ſo neer to him, as that peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, which he makes a Kingdom of Preiſts. But they have a portion that is full and ſufficient, comming from the hand of their everlaſting father, who like to Jacob in the type, hath his ſpecially beloved Joſephs and Benjamins by Rachel, the choice delight of his eyes, and hath his ten ſons beſides, that are alſo children of his bleſſing, ſons and not baſtards or caſt-awayes, but ſuch as he ownes for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, and makes heirs of his Kingdom. They are provided with inheritances in the land of promiſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93838:52"/>
            <p>And as there is ſuch an everlaſting love and ſalvation ſpoken of in the ſcripture, which is called common in the reſpect above mentioned, ſo is there alſo a common faith and ſalvation, that is but temporary, begets but ſuch a repentance unto life (as the effect of it upon the minde) from whence there is a turning away againe and a drawing back unto perdition. This kind of beleevers, in ſtead of holding faſt faith and a good conſcience, do put away their good conſcience, and concerning faith do make shipwrack, being not able to ride it out in the ſtormy weather of temptations. They do therefore declare by the event, that they never had faith of the right kind, but that the chang of mind brought upon them by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the goſpel, and knowledg of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, amounted but to ſuch a repentance as might againe be repented of or turned from, and but to ſuch a faith as might faile, though both were the fruits of the goſpel, or good tydings of the worke of redemption and reconciliation, wrought in the perſon of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, as miniſtred but by the firſt and conditionall Covenant, which obliges the children of it in a debt to the whole law, upon the terms of renewing to them their primitive naturall activity and uſe of their freewill, for the performance thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt gives himſelf to be the life and reconciliation of the whole world, commanding all men every where to repent, excluding none from this benefit of his death, the atonement of ſins paſt, and after this manner to have faith and repentance wrought in them, if the fault lie not in themſelvs.</p>
            <p>The ſame goſpel then and bleſſed knowledg of our Lord and ſaviour Jeſus Chriſt, is in the miniſtry and preaching of it, the everlaſting goſpel, (as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with fruits that end in ſalvation, and are permanent and abiding) and is alſo the goſpel whoſe candle may be put out, and candleſtick removed out of its place, as Chriſt not only threatned to the ſeven churches of Aſia, but actually executed, upon their apoſtaſy and unworthy walking under the light thereof.</p>
            <p>And if the ſcope and intent of the Epiſtle of Jude be well weighed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his expreſſions, wherein he makes mention of the common ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and faith once delivered unto the ſaints, we shall find that he does very evidently ſet forth the diviſion and contention which did ariſe in his time, between theſe two miniſtries of the goſpel, and thoſe that had theſe differing effects and operations produced thereby upon their hearts. For the ſame common ſalvation and change, wrought by the preaching of it, upon the minds of the hearers, which begot in them repentance from dead works, and faith towards God, if it were accompanied with the faith of the right kind, once delivered to the ſaincts, through the power of which we are
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93838:52"/> kept unto ſalvation, he shewes plainly, (v. 20, 21.) that being built up in this our moſt holy faith, and praying in the holy Ghoſt, we shalbe kept from falling, and shall keep ourſelvs in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto eternall life.</p>
            <p>But if this faith be wanting, whatever other effects, enlightnings or quicknings, the knowledg of Chriſt and preaching of the goſpel may have upon us, in the judgment of the Apoſtle Jude, ſuch are to be looked upon as having no more certainty of ſalvation, nor probability of a good end, then thoſe of the children of Iſrael, that the Lord ſaved out of Egypt and the houſe of bondage, but deſtroyed before they entered into Canaan; or then thoſe angels that fell, and kept not their firſt habitation, or then Sodom and Gomorrah; Yea, or then the rejected nation of the jews, by whoſe wicked hands our ſaviour was crucified. They ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone, and though they ſought after righteouſnes, yet was it, as it were, by the works of the law; children they were, in whom (as it is written, Deut. 32.20.) there was no faith. Upon this very ground, the church of the gentiles that were taken into the place of the jews, and had Gods name called upon them, doe run the ſame hazard with the Jewish church, that is, of being cut off from the good olive tree, when they shalbe found to be but ſuch as have not their ſtanding by the faith that is triall proof. They therefore shall in like manner be ſwallowed up into a univerſall and moſt ſignall apoſtaſy from the truth and power of the goſpel, a little before Chriſts ſecond comming.</p>
            <p>It is no marvell then that the Apoſtle Jude is ſo earneſt in exhorting to contend earneſtly for the faith, as it is of the right kind and primitive purity, wherein it was once delivered to the ſaincts, bringing forth thoſe fruits in them that accompanied ſalvation, and were not to be fallen from. This contention, warfare or battel was in heaven, in the very church itſelf, between thoſe that had a ſtronger and firmer birth of grace, and thoſe of a weaker, that was wavering, uncertaine, and capable to prove abortive, as not comming of Sarah, the free woman, that is the mother of us all. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles, in this conteſt and warfare, the woman that brings forth the manchild, is neceſſitated to fly for it into the wildernes, though a conquerour, whilſt the battel was fought out by ſpirituall weapons only, in a church way. For when once the secular powers came to exerciſe a ruling ſtroke and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive juriſdiction in the Chriſtian religion, then she betook herſelf to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, became ſolitary and neglected by men. In that wildernes ſtate, the remnant of the womans ſeed, that keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, continue (for a ſeaſon) trod under foot, and oppreſſed by their oppoſite brethren
<pb facs="tcp:93838:53"/> that are countenanc'd and upheld againſt them, by the power and ſtrength of the Kingdom of the beaſt. For having got poſſeſſion of the outward court of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is left out, as no longer regarded by God, they become a fit ſeat for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts throne, a great bulwarke and ſtrong hold for the man of ſin and Son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereby to maintein his war againſt thoſe worshippers that are ſo in ſpirit and truth, and not in word or forme only, and whoſe place it is to officiate either in the temple itſelf, or in the moſt in ward and moſt holy part of it, called the Holy of Holies.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſtinguished between that which in Scripture is called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith, or common ſalvation, in theſe its two differing effects and fruits, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in ſome a birth of life and grace which is immutable and cannot fayle or be fallen from; and in others, a birth of repentance and faith that is changable, may be repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of, shipwrack'd and miſcarry; it remains for us to proceed in deſcribing and declaring the ſecond and higher degree that is atteinable in that faith which was once delivered to the Saincts, called by Jude, our moſt holy faith. He ſeemes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to intimate, that by the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt and miniſtry of the Goſpel, faith may be wrought and begotten in the heart, according to a threefold degree, wherein righteouſnes and true holines is revealed from faith to faith; from faith of the loweſt ranke, which is that that failes, to that of the ſecond ranke, which failes not, but makes us conquerours, and from thence to that of the higheſt ranke, which gives us power with God to prevaile in all things we deſire, beyond all we can aske or think, making us more then conquerours, and with Abraham to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the friends of God. The firſt is holy, the ſecond is more holy, the third is our moſt holy faith.</p>
            <p>The moſt holy faith is that which (Epheſ. 3.16.) is ſaid to be granted or given of the riches of Gods glory, wherein he hath an inheritance in his ſaincts, (chap. 1.18.) and through which he does put forth the exceeding greatnes of his power, towards us that beleeve, according to what he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his owne right hand in the heavenly, far above all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, power, might, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come. So then, according to the power of this exceeding mighty operation of God in that gift of Chriſts Spirit, wherein he grants to ſome Saincts to beare a more peculiar likenes to him, the beleever becomes ſo exceedingly ſtrengthned with might in the inner man, ſo rooted and grounded in love, that he is not only made able to comprehend with all Saints, that are ſons after the common faith, what is the length, breadth, depth and height of the knowledg and love of God that shines forth in Chriſt, as he is the Son of man, made head of all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, which is the higheſt image of God, short of the fathers naked ſimilitude, in his owne proper shape and forme; but he is (over and above all this) enabled to know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledg, and to behold God in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93838:53"/> that glory of his, that shines forth in the face of the bleſſed Trinity, wherein he hath bin delighting himſelf in and with the eternall WORD, from before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
            <p>Into this glory, Chriſt in his manhood, as our fore-runner, is entered, even within the moſt inward veyle.</p>
            <p>This was the forme of God, wherein Chriſt was found, before he aſſumed his manhood, and he reteins his manhood both in an inferiority to it and in an equality with it, by reaſon whereof, Chriſt as man, without robbery is accounted equall with God. In this ſtate of glory, he is the bridegroome to this moſt excellent ſort of beleevers, who therefore dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but are a peculiar nation of Gods jewells and choice treaſure, a Kingdom of preiſts, his heritage and immediate poſſeſſion, that as the Tribe of Levi, are made to approach neer unto him, in ſtead of all the firſt born ſons of Iſrael. Theſe are the 144000, deſcribed (Revel. 14.) to be ſuch as have their fathers name written in their foreheads, and that are not defiled with women, but are virgins which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb whitherſoever he goes, and are redeemed from among men, as the firſt fruits to God and to the lamb; the pure, undefiled bride and ſpouſe of the lamb, that is the only one of her mother.</p>
            <p>Theſe are farther deſcribed (Revel. 7.) as thoſe that are the choſen out of every Tribe of the choſen ſeed of God, by a ſmall certain number of 144000, a royall preiſthood, ſelected and taken out of all the Tribes. Theſe being thus firſt ſelected out, how are the remaining parts in and of every Tribe conſidered? Are they looked upon by God, as the world? as a people left to themſelvs? No, by no means, but alſo as Gods choſen people, in relation to the reſt of the world. They are his ſons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common faith, making up the gentile fulnes, as the other doe the Iews. And accordingly, in their gentile fulnes, or rather as ſurrogated Iews, (Rom. 11.) have the ſutable characters given to them. For (ſayes the Apoſtle Iohn) after this, I beheld, and ſo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, kindreds and tongues, ſtood before the throne and before the lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands, repreſenting their victorious faith, in and under the great tribulations they had and were to paſſe through, in participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Chriſt in his ſufferings, for the teſtimony of Ieſus, during the reigne of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt theſe, he that ſits on the throne shall dwell for ever. And they will neither hunger nor thirſt any more, nor shall the ſun light on them, nor any heat, for the lamb will feed them and lead them into living fountains of waters, in the ſtate of the firſt Reſurrection, where all tears shalbe wiped away from their eyes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe then whoſe hearts are purified by this faith, in either of theſe two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, as it is our precious or our moſt precious faith, (that which brings us into the common ſtate of ſalvation with the gentiles, that is durable and everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93838:54"/> or that which brings us yet farther, into the peculiar priviledg of the Jews and firſt born Sons or God) are the people that properly are Abrahams ſeed, and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe. And their day of manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haſtens apace. They have bin hitherto, even from the beginning of the world to this day, a ſeed of hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, inviſible ones, that in all changes of times remaine the pure inviſible church. And they have all along bin kept undefiled, having that birth of God in them which preſervs them, that ſin does not adulterate their hearts, or alienate them from God, neither can the evill one touch them. Thus was it with the ſeven thouſand concealed pure and ſpirituall worshippers that God had reſerved in a time of univerſall apoſtacy and corruption in his viſible worship, (in Eliah's time) which never did nor would bow their knee to Baal.</p>
            <p>In reference to this ſeed, in all ages, is verified that which is ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſay, (chap. 1.9.) Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left unto us (that are the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church, and have the viſible ſignes of Gods preſence and the purity of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances amongſt us) a very ſmall remnant, (a ſeed of hidden ones) we had bin as Sodom in the height of ſinning, and bin made like unto Gomorrha, in the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarines of our punishment.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they that God accounts his jewels, the people that are of price and value with him, whatever reproach and diſeſteeme they are in from the world, in all times. Theſe have that faith in the ſeed of it, by which they are poſſeſt with an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do all things for the truth, and nothing againſt it; and this, through Chriſt the power of God, inwardly ſtrengthening and bringing them forth into a likenes of ability with himſelf, to do all things by his quickning of them, as he himſelf hath done by the fathers quickning of him: that they may live by him, as he himſelf, according to his manhood, lives by the father, who does in him all the works.</p>
            <p>God hath now for neer theſe ſix thouſand years, kept theſe his jewels by him as a reſerved hidden treaſure, that he reſolvs in a fit ſeaſon to bring to light, and make a shew of openly, in the ſight of the whole world. In the mean time, he calls them into the ſecret chambers of his love, and is encreaſing their faith and patience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great and various trialls wherein they are with God, ſtrangers and ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in and to the world, and to the delights and comforts of it, as all their fathers were.</p>
            <p>This time of hardship and ſuffring from the world, muſt not alwayes be their lot. There is a day approaching, wherein the time of their ill uſage from the world shalbe no longer. God will have his ſeaſon to shew kindnes and love to them and to do them honour in the ſight of the whole creation; a day, in which his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and determined reſolution is, to make up his jewels, and bring them all together, from all parts where he hath kept them hid and concealed. In this day, he will ſpare them and shew favour to them, as the father ſpares his owne ſon that ſerveth him, and in ſerving pleaſeth him.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93838:54"/>
            <p>And ſo viſible a diſtinction in this day will God put in the way of the diſpenſations of his providences, even to the eye of the world, between them that ſerve him and them that ſerve him not, between the righteous and the wicked, that every eye shall take notice of it. And it shall have ſuch a powerfull effect upon the beholders, that there shall come people, the inhabitants of many cities, yea, the inhabitants of one city shall goe to another, ſaying, let us goe ſpeedily and continually to pray before the Lord of hoſts; I will goe alſo. Yea, many people and ſtrong nations shall come to ſeek the Lord of hoſts in Jeruſalem, and to pray before the Lord. Ten man shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, on the skirt of him that is a jew, ſaying, we will goe with you, for we have heard that God is with you. The jews that they will thus take hold of, wilbe ſuch as are ſo indeed, having the faith that failes not, but makes them the receavers of that anointing which teacheth all things, and is truth and no lie.</p>
            <p>By this heavenly anointing they are in their very principles diſtinguished,</p>
            <p n="1">I. From thoſe, whoſe faith is ſo far from being of the ſame precious kind with theirs, that it is ſure to faile in the moſt needfull time, in the day of temptation and triall, when the winds blow and the rain deſeends, and the floods come, and beat upon them. Such faith is of little or no price.</p>
            <p>Secondly. The true Jew, by his faith and anointing, wilbe likewiſe diſtinguish'd from thoſe that have no faith, but are unreaſonable perſecutours of thoſe that have, being void of all right diſcerning in matters of faith,</p>
            <p>Theſe true Jews and Iſraelits indeed, are (as we have shewed) the two families in Jacobs houſe, children of the ſame Jacob, but not by the ſame Rachel, of whom were only Joſeph and Benjamin. This diſtinction in Jacobs family ſeems to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by the holy Ghoſt, (Ezek. 37.16.) where the twelve Tribes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to two ſticks, or ſtems, ſpringing out of the ſame root, as two houſes, nations or families of the ſame Iſrael. Upon the one ſtick, the Prophet was commanded to write, for Judah and for the children of Iſrael his companions, to whom (as we know) the Kingdom and ſcepter was aſſigned, and out of whom Chriſt according to the flesh, came. Upon the other ſtick there was to be written, for Joſeph the ſtick of Ephraim, and for all the houſe of Iſrael, his companions. For the ſeperated one from his brethren, the exalted one above his brethren, the dreamer, to whoſe sheafe all the other sheaves, yea, the ſun, moon and ſtars were to do obeyſance. To him in a word, was aſſigned the firſt birthright, in the double portion of it, the upper and the nether ſprings, the bleſſings of heaven above, of the deep that lieth under, of the breaſts and of the womb, the bleſſings of the father that have prevailed above the bleſſings of his progenitours, in an extent to the utmoſt bounds of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting hills, that are appointed to be on the head of Ioſeph, and on the crowne of the head of him that was ſeparate from his brethren.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the bleſſings written for Ioſeph, and for all the houſe of Iſrael his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93838:55"/> or of his faith, ſpirit, and principles. Both theſe ſticks (the two houſes or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of beleevers and Iſraelits in deed) are to be made up into one new Ieruſalem, in Chriſts hand. Both flocks are to be gathered into one sheepfold and viſible univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall church-ſtate of the revealed ſons of God, diſtinguished from all people on the face of the earth, beſides. And they shalbe gathered into one univerſall Kingdom and civil ſtate, that shall beare rule over the whole world. For thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I will take the children of Iſrael, (the ſcattered sheep belonging to this fold) from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every ſide, and will bring them into their owne land, even into the promiſed new Ieruſalem ſtate, the new heavens and new earth, wherein dwells righteouſnes, figured out by the land of Canaan. And I will make them one nation or ſeed of my bleſſing in the land, upon the mountains of Iſrael, and one King shalbe King to them all. And though Iudah shall be there with his companions, and Ioſeph with his, under diſtinct writings and enrollings, aſſigning unto each their lot, yet both shall make but one church and Kingdom, one ſpirituall ſeed or nation of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. They shall no more be two, ſo as to be divided into two Kingdoms, either in church or ſtate. They shall neither envy nor vex one another, any more. They shall be fully agreed, and live in peace, as inhabitants of the ſame city, the new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, uppet and lower, as the hebrew word imports, (Pſ. 51.) or heavenly and earthly, conſiſting of ſons of a higher and lower dignity, of this man and of that man that is borne there, whether of noble or common degree, all free heaven-born citizens and ſubjects of one and the ſame great and univerſall King. They shall dwell in perfect unity together, and be of one accord as brethren, ſinging the ſong of Moſes and of the lambe, in ſweet harmony and conſort, and the ſtranger and the uncleane shall no more paſſe through this glorious city. For there shall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that does defile, nor that worketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they only which are written (with the writing that is upon both thoſe ſtickes before-mentioned) in the lambs both of life.</p>
            <p>This is the church and civill ſtate, which the miniſtry of Eliah is to prepare the way unto, as the end to which all the work of reſtitution which thereby shalbe wrought, does and muſt tend. This will be effected by the powerfull preaching of the everlaſting goſpel, by a miniſtry that shall have the tongues not of men only but of angels, filled with the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, as alſo yeilding vengeance and flames of fire, as a day of great judgment and diſtinction that is to be brought and executed upon ungodly men and willfull oppoſers of that work, by the pouring out upon them the ſeven vialls of Gods wrath, like as Moſes his miniſtry did upon Pharaoh King of Egypt, ſo long as he hardned himſelf and refuſed to let Iſrael his ſon and his firſt born goe free, and ſerve him according to his duty.</p>
            <p>By Eliahs ſecond comming then, (according to the particulars before declared, together with the end itſelf, in order to which, this miniſtry of reſtoring all things is appointed) we are to underſtand no other then the ſpirit and power wherein the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93838:55"/> ſlaine witneſſes of Chriſt shalbe quickned, made to ſtand upon their feet, and have withall an aſcent given to them into heaven, as viſible aſſociates and copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with the holy angels, in their power and great glory, like bright morning ſtarrs, and ſignes of the comming of the ſon of man, even whilſt they are yet remaining in the body, on this ſide death.</p>
            <p>This ſecond comming of Eliah therefore is not to be confounded with Chriſts owne perſonall comming, which ſucceeds, and comes to give us actually and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly a part in that which (Rev. 20.) is called the firſt reſurrection. The change effected by Eliah's comming, will rather be a transfiguration, then what properly can be called the firſt reſurrection, by which our bodies wilbe made like unto that glorious body of Chriſt, in which he lived on earth, fourty dayes before his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in which power and glory he is to shine forth, like the ſun in his ſtrength, as the brightnes of the day of his ſecond comming encreaſes and riſes up to its height. For the ushering in hereof, this ſigne in heaven of the ſon of mans comming, is to go before, which (as hath bin ſaid) is no other then the ſpirit and power which the ſlain witneſſes, (or the dried, diſperſed bones and members of Chriſts dead body, his hidden, inviſible ſeed of beleevers, his church at that time on the earth) shalbe quickned and raiſed up into, as a heaven upon earth, in the ſight of the whole world. The wiſe or teachers that then shalbe among them, shall shine as the brightnes of the firmament; and they that turne many to righteouſnes, as the ſtars for evermore.</p>
            <p>By the power of that faith which brings life and immortality to light, in the minds of thoſe that are true Iſraelits indeed, inhabitants of the new and heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem that is above, we have declared, that Abraham in type and Chriſt in ſpirit and truth, is the father unto two ſorts of Sons, that are both heirs and witneſſes of what they ſe and heare from Chriſt. They are both written among the living in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, with a writing that is never to be defaced or blotted out. Some of them are made conquerours, and others of them more then conquerours, through Chriſt that hath loved them, and cauſed them to abide and continue with him in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and to beare a conformity in their minds to his death, (armed with the ſame mind as he was, for ſuffering in the flesh) as well as carrying about in their bodies, the marks of the dying of the Lord Jeſus. They have heard and receaved that language of faith in them and to them, with which Paul acquaints us (Tim. 2.2. 11, 12.) If we be dead with him, we shall live with him: if we ſuffer, we shall alſo reigne with him. Unto this carkaſſe or dead body, the eagles, the fowles of heaven, by a miniſtry of the ſpirit of life from God, wilbe gathered together. And as a breath from the foure winds of heaven, a wind of propheſy and divine inſpiration, in the ſpirit and power of Eliah, shall come forth and shew itſelf in theſe ſlain wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, where ever they shalbe found, throughout the whole world, and bring them together into one sheepfold of viſible government both in church and ſtate. In this poſture, it will be found moſt true, that by fire from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93838:56"/> heaven, and as the Lords owne ſword, they shall plead with all flesh, and the ſlaine of the Lord shalbe many, that shall fall under them, in attempting to riſe up againſt them. For in and by this miniſtry of Eliah, the Lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirl-wind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebukes with flames of fire.</p>
            <p>When you shalbe awakened to ſe, by the comming of this glorious miniſtry of God, what in this day shalbe wrought, not by might, nor by power, but by the ſpirit of the Lord, the ſeven eyes which run to and fro through the whole earth, (rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to ſe his work goe on, and taking care that there be ſutable diſpenſations of divine providences to further and advance it, whereof the deciſion to be made in the valley of Iehoſaphat will not be the leaſt) then your heart shall rejoyce and your bones flourish like an herbe, and the hand of the Lord shalbe knowne towards his Servants, and his indignation towards his enemies. Then shall the thoughts and words of the enemies of Gods people, in deſigning againſt them, (however hidden and ſecret, even in their very bedchambers) be knowne and diſcovered by this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Eliah, and the Mountains full of horſes and chariots of fire shalbe like walls round about the city of God, to defend them. And not only the eyes of the Prophet, the eyes of the inward man of the Saincts, or of the ſpirit of their mind, but the eyes of the Prophets ſervant alſo, the beaſt on which he rides, the ſenſual and outward man of the ſoule, in the exerciſe of the very bodily ſenſes, shalbe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſe that there are more with the people of God then can be againſt them. So shall all feare be removed far from them.</p>
            <p>To the word of this Eliahs miniſtry in the hearts of beleevers, the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shalbe obedient. The heavens at their prayers will shut or open. They shall do greater things on earth, then ever yet have bin done, by the power that Chriſt hath with the father, which in this day he will begin viſibly to ſet on work, and exerciſe for the good of his people.</p>
            <p>But the great queſtion is, when shall theſe things be?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. The ſigne of Chriſts comming is already ſpoken to, in this miniſtry of Eliah, which does immediatly goe before it. And when this miniſtry comes and reveales itſelf in power, (as it muſt in the hearts of all the true Iſrael of God) it will untie all the knots and difficulties that do yet remaine to be reſolved, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſts ſecond appearance, and things to come.</p>
            <p>But when may this ſecond comming of Eliah be expected?</p>
            <p n="1">1. After that Chriſt in ſpirit hath as ſignally bin rejected by the generation of Jews under the goſpel, (which were ſurrogated and engraffed in the room of Abrahams naturall ſeed) as he was by that Jewish nation which crucified him at Jeruſalem. And when (accordingly) they shall have openly declared it, by the like ſevere proceedings againſt the true ſpirit of prophecy, manifeſting itſelf in Chriſts witneſſes, who by humane laws and bodily punishments wilbe ſuppreſſed, kept
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93838:56"/> under and put to death, as much as lies in man to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly; When this perſecution and rejection of Chriſt in his members, hath had its progreſſe and courſe with the preaching of the goſpel itſelf, during the ſix trumpets, from the one end of the earth to the other, which hath shined as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the eaſt to the weſt; and when the goſpel and obeyers of it, shall meet with the sharpeſt brunt of oppoſition, ſo as that the dead bodies of the witneſſes shall not be ſuffered to be put in their graves, during the laſt three years and half of this houre and power of darknes that is to come upon the church of Gods hidden ones, the remnant of the womans ſeed, that keep the commandments of God and faith of Jeſus. But they are nevertheles helped and much ſaved from the flood of their enemies malice, by the like miſtake as was that of Herod, who slew all the children from two years old and upwards, hoping amongſt them to find the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſeed, but failed. The earth helps the woman. The earthly Ieruſalem with her inhabitants shall prove a skreene to the heavenly Mount Zion.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. When the wiſe virgins as wel as the foolish, shalbe found in a deep ſleep of ſecurity, and think the worſt paſt, looking for nothing more but the comming of the bridegroom, before it be yet midnight.</p>
            <p>The witneſſes of Chriſt wilbe ready to make account that their 1260 years of ſuffering under the reigne of the beaſt, is either expired or upon the very point of expiring, and therefore begin to put off their ſackcloth, or lay it quite aſide, as taking for graunted that the time is come, that ſorrow and ſighing are flowne away, never to returne more. But they will afterwards find themſelvs deceaved, and that they are but falling into the times of the three laſt years and halfe, it being Gods uſuall and accuſtomed method from the beginning, to usher in any great exaltation of his ſaincts, with ſome deſperate extreamity and calamity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly foregoing. And therefore, till after the wiſe virgins ſun be turned into darknes, and the foolish virgins moon be turned into blood, the BRIGHT MORNING STAR of Eliahs miniſtry comes not. But then, it does immediatly follow.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly and laſtly; when Antichriſt and all enemies of the witneſſes of Chriſt shalbe in the greareſt peace, unity and joy imaginable, amongſt themſelvs, at the beholding the dead bodies of the two prophets that tormented them that dwell upon the earth, and shall cry peace, peace, as eſteeming their mountaine to be made ſo ſtrong, that it can never be moved. In one word; When the ſunshine of their proſperity, peace and power is at the height, and to their thinking, impoſſible ever to ſet againe.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice, without proceeding farther to ſpeak concerning the two other parts of this great day of Chriſts ſecond comming, which wilbe dignified with his owne perſonall reigne on earth, the THOVSAND YEERS of the FIRST RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SURRECTION. Then will he put an end to this very day of his owne Kingdom,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93838:57"/> by his free and voluntary reſigning it up into the hands of the father, that God may be all in all: Let me only adde this word, that the viſible reigne of theſe ſaints of the firſt RESURRECTION here on earth, for a thouſand years, wilbe in the new Jeruſalem ſtate, that is to come downe from God out of heaven; in a ſtate of beatitude and glory, partaking of the divine preſence and viſion of Chriſt their King, in an immutable righteous ſtate both of body and Soule, diſtinguished from the ſtate of the nations that shall walke in her light, all the world over, and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and glorious alſo, but changeable.</p>
